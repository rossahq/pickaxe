CLAIM sentence:  I also met the Chairs of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the Justice Committee to discuss the best way forward

CLAIM sentence:  It is one of the largest currently under way in the country, and is being carried out by a completely different team from the one that carried out the original investigation

CLAIM sentence:  The team has contacted  people so far, and will contact every single person named in those documents

CLAIM sentence:  Last week in the House I set out our intention to establish an independent public inquiry into phone hacking and other illegal practices in the British press

CLAIM sentence:  We want it to be one that is as robust as possible one that can get to the truth fastest and also get to work the quickest, and, vitally, one that commands the full confidence of the public

CLAIM sentence:  First, we need a full investigation into wrongdoing in the press and the police, including the failure of the first police investigation

CLAIM sentence:  We would like to get on with both those elements as quickly as possible, while being mindful of the ongoing criminal investigations

CLAIM sentence:  He will report to both the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport

CLAIM sentence:  The inquiry will be established under the Inquiries Act , which means that it will have the power to summon witnesses, including newspaper reporters, management, proprietors, policemen and politicians of all parties, to give evidence under oath and in public

CLAIM sentence:  He will make recommendations for a new, more effective way of regulating the pressone that supports its freedom, plurality and independence from Government, but which also demands the highest ethical and professional standards

CLAIM sentence:  He will also make recommendations about the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press

CLAIM sentence:  That part of the inquiry we hope will report within  months

CLAIM sentence:  That part of the inquiry will also look into the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers, and will consider the implications for the relationships between newspapers and the police

CLAIM sentence:  The Terms of Reference were then the subject of further discussion both with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and other interested parties

CLAIM sentence:  With allegations that the problem of the relationship between the press and the police goes wider than just the Met, we have agreed that other relevant forces will now be within the scope of the inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  We have agreed that the inquiry should consider not just the relationship between the press, police and politicians, but their individual conduct too

CLAIM sentence:  We have also made it clear that the inquiry should look not just at the press, but at other media organisations, including broadcasters and social media if there is any evidence that they have been involved in criminal activities

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry, as finally drafted, are: part  

CLAIM sentence:  To inquire into the culture, practices, and ethics of the press, including:  HC Hansard,  July , vol , col   PART A | The InquiryA\xc(a) contacts and the relationships between national newspapers and politicians, and the conduct of each; (b) contacts and the relationship between the press and the police, and the conduct of each; (c) the extent to which the current policy and regulatory framework has failed including in relation to data protection; and (d) the extent to which there was a failure to act on previous warnings about media misconduct

CLAIM sentence:  To make recommendations: (a) for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime which supports the integrity and freedom of the press, the plurality of the media, and its independence, including from Government, while encouraging the highest ethical and professional standards; (b) for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and cross-media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities, including Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police; (c) the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press; and (d) the future conduct of relations between the police and the press

CLAIM sentence:  A Director General with a legal background and experience at the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Rowena Collins Rice was an ideal appointment as Secretary to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  I also set about appointing counsel

CLAIM sentence:  With the assistance of the Treasury Solicitor, I selected Robert Jay QC to be Counsel to the Inquiry; with my approval he nominated David Barr and Carine Patry Hoskins as junior Counsel, later adding Lucinda Boon for Module  (concerning the relationship between the press and the police)

CLAIM sentence:  Counsel were assisted by junior members of the Bar in relation to the necessary research for both preparing the examination of witnesses and the subsequent collation of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  At the very beginning of this Report, it is appropriate to record my enormous gratitude to the Assessors, to Counsel and to the entire Inquiry team (whose names are set out in Appendix A to this Report) for their unstinting commitment to the Inquiry and the prodigious effort that has been put into ensuring that it proceeded smoothly, to budget and, most important, was able appropriately to address the Terms of Reference within a time frame that aIlows early consideration to be given by the Government and Parliament to the way forward

CLAIM sentence:  role of the assessors 

CLAIM sentence:  From the outset, challenges were mounted by a number of press interests to the way in which the Inquiry was set up and, in particular, to the experience, role and responsibility of the Assessors

CLAIM sentence:  At the opening session of the Inquiry, I spoke of the Assessors having a central role in the work so that the report would be a collaborative effort and that if a particular recommendation was not unanimous, I shall make the contrary view clear

CLAIM sentence:  In the event that an Assessor prepared a report that I intended to take into account, paragraph  of the Protocol made it clear that it should be disclosed to the Core Participants (who could submit observations upon it) and thereafter published as part of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, I have not asked any Assessor to prepare a report that I intend to take into account; there is no question of any providing me with evidence or other material which it is appropriate to share with Core Participants in order that they may make submissions about it

CLAIM sentence:  The extent to which the Assessors would take part in or impact upon my conclusions was also explained in my ruling which includes a description of their role and responsibilities in these terms: 

CLAIM sentence:  The assessors also bring an understanding of the practical implications of potential ways forward what may, or may not, work in the fields of their respective expertise

CLAIM sentence:  It is that to which I refer when I speak of being collaborative and striving for unanimity

CLAIM sentence:  The process I envisage would entail, amongst other things, seeking the assistance and advice of my assessors but, as I have also explained, I may also test out possible solutions in further seminars

CLAIM sentence:  Again, with fairness as my touchstone, if I believe that new material is generated, that material will be shared so that all can make submissions upon it

CLAIM sentence:   Ultimately, however, as I have made very clear, my conclusions shall be solely my conclusions

CLAIM sentence:  In the spirit of openness and transparency, however, I shall identify the fact that one or more of the assessors disagrees with my conclusions and I shall explain the nature of the disagreement: in that way, those who read my report will be able to make up their own minds

CLAIM sentence:  The Assessors have been scrupulous to follow the approach set out in the Protocol and ruling

CLAIM sentence:  They have assisted in relation to avenues of investigation and lines of enquiry both generally and to specific witnesses

CLAIM sentence:  Although there has been repeated criticism of the Inquiry for not  http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Assessor-Protocol--October-

CLAIM sentence:  In doing so, they have continuously emphasised the perspective that was trailed particularly by Trevor Kavanagh and Kelvin MacKenzie in the seminars and underlined by editors and journalists working for titles from these sectors when they gave evidence

CLAIM sentence:  It is obviously desirable (as the Prime Minister and others have identified) that I obtain advice and assistance from those who have made their lives and careers in the various areas covered by the Inquiry, in particular in relation to dealings between the press and the public, the press and politicians and the propriety of press contact with the police

CLAIM sentence:  Not least, this is because I would be keen to understand any flaws or unintended consequences that might flow from suggestions that are advanced that my lack of experience would not otherwise identify

CLAIM sentence:  That is not to make the assessors advocates for any particular cause and that is not how I (or they) see their role

CLAIM sentence:  Neither has any of the Assessors sought to act as an advocate

CLAIM sentence:  It has recently been suggested in a number of press reports that, in the some way, I have been subject, on the part of my Assessors, to hidden lobbying, political partisanship or self-interested influence with specific agendas in mind

CLAIM sentence:  That is untrue

CLAIM sentence:  Having spent over  years seeking to persuade or influence, or listening to others trying to do the same, if it had been attempted or even crept in unconsciously, I would have detected it very quickly

CLAIM sentence:  I have found the assistance of my Assessors, in their areas of expertise and experience, invaluable

CLAIM sentence:  After they were nominated, I spoke to each at length and satisfied myself that the Prime Minister was right

CLAIM sentence:  Full declarations of possible conflict were made by each before the start of the Inquiry: along with their CVs, these have been published on the Inquiry website throughout

CLAIM sentence:  When challenging the position of the Assessors in the argument that led to the ruling to which I have referred, Jonathan Caplan QC for Associated Newspapers Ltd submitted that the three journalist Assessors were not representative of the industry but made it clear, in terms, that he recognised that there was no statutory requirement that an Assessor be impartial

CLAIM sentence:  It is an Assessors task to offer me the benefit of his or her personal perspective, expertise and experience

CLAIM sentence:  The duty of confidence which the Assessors owe by law in relation to the internal deliberations of the Inquiry is there to enable them to provide their expertise fully and frankly and to protect them from external pressures

CLAIM sentence:  In fact, nothing that the Assessors have said or done during the course of the Inquiry would allow anyone to suggest that they had gone any further than precisely to perform the role set out in my ruling

CLAIM sentence:  I make one further point about the Assessors

CLAIM sentence:  None has been concerned with or involved in any the decisions of fact, where I have had to make my mind up about what I considered had been established to the relevant standard

CLAIM sentence:  Those parts of the Report that depend only on a forensic analysis of issues of fact or issues outside their expertise (for example, Part I Chapter  in relation to the bid for the shares of BSkyB plc), have not even been seen prior to publication of the Report

CLAIM sentence:  I was treated with courtesy at each and shown not only the layout and operation but also aspects of the production of online editions

CLAIM sentence:  Towards the end of the hearings, I was invited to the offices of the Press Complaints Commission: having regard to the very extensive evidence that I had received both as to the operation of the Commission and the approach of its staff, I felt that to do so could give rise to misunderstanding and, furthermore, did not consider that it would add to my understanding of the issues

CLAIM sentence:  This Inquiry is unlike any other for a number of reasons

CLAIM sentence:  The principal reason concerns the way in which Inquiries are generally conducted

CLAIM sentence:  Usually, an event such as a disaster or other type of incident giving rise to public concern occurs

CLAIM sentence:  The natural anxiety is to learn, first of all, what precisely has caused the event to happen and, thereafter, what should be done to prevent repetition

CLAIM sentence:  A civil (or criminal) trial would then go further and determine the standard required by the civil (or criminal) law and decide whether that standard has been met

CLAIM sentence:  If it has not, civil (or criminal) liability will result

CLAIM sentence:  In the former case, damages or some other remedy will follow to benefit those who have suffered injury or financial loss as a consequence

CLAIM sentence:  A conviction in a criminal trial will lead to the imposition of a sanction or sentence

CLAIM sentence:  An Inquiry, however, does not lead to these consequences

CLAIM sentence:  The most important are Operation Weeting (into the interception of mobile telephone messages), Operation Elveden (into the payment of police officers, and, indeed, others holding public office or position, by the press) and Operation Tuleta (into other forms of computer hacking)

CLAIM sentence:  These and other subsidiary investigations are proceeding apace and, during the course of the Inquiry, there have been a large number of arrests with journalists and others being bailed for further inquiries to be made

CLAIM sentence:  In a number of cases, criminal prosecutions have been commenced; these are presently awaiting trial and I anticipate that there will continue to be developments in the period which follows the publication of this Report

CLAIM sentence:  One consequence, however, is that any investigation of the facts has inevitably been circumscribed, in particular, by an inability to investigate the full detail of specific criminality in the core areas of interception of mobile telephone voice mail messages and alleged bribery of public officials

CLAIM sentence:  Concern about this type of activity constituted an important factor leading to the establishment of this Inquiry and the issue cannot be ignored: it is one of the central reasons for public concern about the conduct of the press (or sections of it)

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to each of those who have been charged or arrested, however, criminal proceedings are active (within the meaning of the Contempt of Court Act )

CLAIM sentence:  First, to avoid prejudice to any criminal investigation or prosecution, there are inevitable limitations on the extent to which it is appropriate to examine the evidence relating to specific incidents of such practices, let alone in relation to the identification of those who might have been involved

CLAIM sentence:  Second, the rights of those who have been charged or arrested must be respected and, in particular, their right not to self incriminate must be protected

CLAIM sentence:  This could arise either by the Inquiry inviting answers to potentially incriminating questions or, inferentially, by putting them in a position that refusal to answer questions itself generates suspicion

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, none of those who have been arrested has been asked questions about interception of voice mail messages or payments to public officials

CLAIM sentence:  Taking full account of these issues, however, the rights of individuals do not mean that it is inappropriate to consider, as a matter of generality, the extent to which there was a recognised and understood willingness to obtain information in this way albeit in some cases, perhaps, without knowledge of (or, at the very least, due regard to) the relevant criminal law

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, Part  of the Terms of Reference covers very much more than this activity

CLAIM sentence:  Without intending to create a definitive list, these include deception (blagging), bullying (by reporters of members of the public and by editors of reporters in order to obtain stories), breaches of privacy and harassment, other forms of intrusion, misleading or inaccurate stories or headlines whether deliberate or accidental, discrimination and other conduct that breaches the Editors Code of Conduct

CLAIM sentence:  Scope This Inquiry has covered the culture, practices and ethics of the press which obviously includes newspapers whether printed or online: it does not include broadcasters (ultimately regulated by Ofcom)

CLAIM sentence:  Part  also covers the culture, practices and ethics of the press across a far wider canvass than the way in which it deals with the public

CLAIM sentence:  It is concerned with the relationship between the press and the police

CLAIM sentence:  It also covers the cross fertilisation of employment with retired senior police officers being engaged as newspaper columnists and journalists being employed in PR departments or as PR advisers by police services

CLAIM sentence:  Part  also deals with the relationship between the press and politicians including, in particular, the perception that, in return for political support, politicians have been too ready to allow undue influence to be exercised in relation to policy and that, in any event, the relationship between the two has not been transparent

CLAIM sentence:  Taken together, this remit is almost breathtaking in its width and, from the beginning, I have been extremely conscious of a number of very significant consequences of the task that I have undertaken and the need to cope with those consequences

CLAIM sentence:  First, it would be all too easy to allow an investigation of the issues to spiral out of control and to become far too enmeshed in detail at the expense of the overall picture

CLAIM sentence:  Examples could be provided of concerns which focus on individual aspects of the Inquiry and it would be entirely legitimate to subject each to detailed analysis, providing the opportunity to anyone affected or potentially affected to challenge the inferences to be drawn

CLAIM sentence:  In some cases, for good reason, detail at that level has, indeed, been necessary

CLAIM sentence:  The contrary approach, with no attention paid to specifics, would risk creating an overview that is far too general and has little value as a true narrative of events

CLAIM sentence:  The need to ensure a balanced approach to the facts has to be reflected in the context of the second consideration

CLAIM sentence:  That is the broad time frame within which it important for me to report

CLAIM sentence:  I put it in that way because, without suggesting that the period of one year identified by the Prime Minister constitutes (or was intended to constitute) a straight-jacket, the imperative to deal with this issue is real; public concern at the time of the closure of the News of the World (NoTW) was intense and it is important to address the problems that were perceived and are now recognised in relation to the regulation of the press as a matter of urgency

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, this consideration chimes with the question of cost

CLAIM sentence:  At a time of fiscal austerity for the public and increasing pressure on the commerciality of the newspaper industry, it was always important that time and the resources of both were well used and not wasted on an analysis of detail that was too extensive and unnecessary for the purposes of providing a sufficient narrative

CLAIM sentence:  Cost is not just about legal and other financial outlay, whether by Core Participant members of the public who do not qualify for legal assistance, public authorities such as the police or police authorities, the newspaper industry or the Ministries required to fund the running of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Cost also encompasses the energy and time commitment of all whether participant or witness, both in responding to calls for evidence (which, in some cases, has involved an enormous amount of work) or attending to give oral evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The third consideration has been my anxiety to ensure that the industry is fully engaged in the process and to avoid the risk that this imposed Inquiry requires or has meant that their only role is to be reactive or, perhaps more serious, entirely defensive

CLAIM sentence:  In that regard, one concern (evidenced in fact) has been that parts of the press would consider that I approached the Inquiry without the necessary and, in my view, entirely appropriate enthusiasm and absolute commitment to freedom of expression and the independence of the press; and that this concern would fashion their approach to the Inquiry, impact on the assistance that they provided and colour the way in which they viewed any conclusion I might reach

CLAIM sentence:  Of course, as many have reported, it has been inevitable that a large body of the evidence would be uncomfortable for the press, if not worse, and that the positive features of our press both at a national and regional level would be lost in the welter of criticism, although reflective consideration will demonstrate that any Inquiry of this nature will inevitably focus on the problems

CLAIM sentence:  The fourth consideration has been the interests of the public

CLAIM sentence:  I have made the point that the public interest in the issues identified in the Terms of Reference is intense and, in my judgment, correctly so

CLAIM sentence:  It has thus been vital to ensure that the Inquiry proceeded in a way that engaged the public and provided appropriate access to it

CLAIM sentence:  By access, I do not mean only that the hearing of the Inquiry would be in public for that goes without saying

CLAIM sentence:  The concern has been to find ways, first, of providing the public with information as to the framework of law and regulation within which the press operate; second, of ensuring that the public has maximum access to the evidence and the material which forms the basis of my Report; third, of allowing and encouraging the public to feed their views into the Inquiry without losing the necessary judicial rigour with which any Inquiry must be conducted or creating the perception that I am effectively engaged in what is little more than a substantial exercise in public consultation

CLAIM sentence:  I approached these problems in a number of different ways which I explain in chronological order of them being put into practice

CLAIM sentence:  In order to provide some coherence to the evidence and so that the public could understand the approach of the Inquiry, the Terms of Reference were split into four modules: the Press and the Public, the Press and the Police, the Press and the Politicians and, finally, the Future

CLAIM sentence:  The first three modules were designed to provide the platform for focused evidence broadly dealing with the topic in question

CLAIM sentence:  I say broadly because I have not wanted to trouble witnesses with necessarily having to return to give evidence for each module

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, during the module concerned with the Press and the Public, the relevant editors were asked about payments or other inducements to police officers (which is Module Two), along with questions about meetings with and influence upon politicians

CLAIM sentence:  From the outset, I have been concerned to challenge all or most of the witnesses to provide ideas for the future

CLAIM sentence:  I have then tested them with other witnesses and encouraged a continued dialogue between all those affected by the issues which are the subject matter of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  In that way, I have endeavoured to ensure that, parallel to the Inquiry, others (including the industry, academic journalists and those interested in this area) engage in dialogues to ensure that all possible mechanisms for regulation are examined and considered

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of Module Four, therefore, was to test possible approaches and so ensure that the final Report did as much as it possibly could to take account of all concerns and reflect a solution that not only balances the legitimate interests of all those affected by the way in which the press goes about its business, but also provides a solution, or series of solutions, that have been submitted to rigorous analysis and, hopefully, can work in the real world

CLAIM sentence:  Briefing sessions In addition to splitting the Terms of Reference into four modules, I took other steps to provide sufficient bedrock on which to build consideration of the evidence as to the need for change and the future

CLAIM sentence:  Having signalled my intentions and rejected submissions that it would not be  A\xcappropriate to proceed in this way, the second preliminary step was to organise a series of briefing sessions to set out the technical, legal and regulatory framework both for me and the assessors

CLAIM sentence:  Although running contrary to my fundamental approach to the Inquiry, I agreed that the technical briefing (to explain methods of interception of telephone and IT systems) should be conducted in private, on the basis that there was no justification for putting into the public domain methods whereby the unscrupulous could learn how to commit what are, in fact, criminal offences

CLAIM sentence:  The other briefings concerned the criminal and civil law framework within which the press operate and the regulatory framework, both in relation to the press (presently through the Press Complaints Commission PCC) and also in other, comparatively related, industries

CLAIM sentence:  Although these briefings were not recorded, transcripts were prepared and anyone interested in the subject matter of the Inquiry has been in a position to acquaint themselves with the framework of law and regulation in order better to understand the issues that the Inquiry intended to address

CLAIM sentence:  The third preliminary step, after the briefing sessions, was to seek to widen understanding of the background and the present state of the industry while at the same time distilling the issues and starting the debate

CLAIM sentence:  The seminars were recorded and a transcript of the day was also prepared: along with the briefing sessions, these remain available on the website and can all be accessed on the website both to watch and to read

CLAIM sentence:  The first set of seminars, on Thursday  October , was called The Competitive Pressures on the Press and the Impact on Journalism

CLAIM sentence:  The second seminar, similarly chaired, was called The Rights and Responsibilities of the Press and received first a presentation from Alan Rusbridger (editor-in-chief of the Guardian) on why a free press matters

CLAIM sentence:  This was followed by Trevor Kavanagh (formerly political editor and now an associate editor and political columnist on The Sun) and Professor Brian Cathcart (formerly deputy editor of The Independent on Sunday and now Professor of Journalism at Kingston University and a founder of the Hacked Off campaign), both of whom spoke about whether there is a difference between the public  The justification for proceeding in this way is explained in my Ruling on the role of the assessors: pp-, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/news-and-events/  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach interest and the interest of the public and what questions this raised in relation to a single set of journalistic ethics

CLAIM sentence:  The third seminar was called Supporting a free press and high standards Approaches to Regulation

CLAIM sentence:  Presentations were provided on the future for self regulation from the different perspectives of a regulator, an editor and a user by Eve Salomon (a former PCC Commissioner and currently Chair of the Internet Watch Foundation), Paul Dacre (editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers Ltd and chair of the Editors Code Committee of the PCC) and Will Moy (Director of Full Fact, an independent fact-checking organisation) respectively

CLAIM sentence:  These seminars had another value, which was to allow me to signal (as I have repeated many times throughout the Inquiry) that I saw the best solution as one that both the press and the public would accept as a realistic approach to the issue of regulation

CLAIM sentence:  The recognition that the PCC no longer held the confidence of the public (whatever might have been the position in the past) was a vital stepping stone to identifying a system that would achieve the legitimate aims of the press while, at the same time, satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the public

CLAIM sentence:  It is obviously important that the system works for the press and that, preferably, it is acceptable to them

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is even more important indeed critical that it works for the public in the sense that the public accept that the press are able to pursue legitimate investigative journalism that is in the public interest, but, at the same time, can be held to account for abuses of the freedoms which they have to pursue stories which have no discernible public interest and whether those abuses are criminal, tortuous, or merely contrary to any recognised code of legitimate journalistic practice

CLAIM sentence:  I believed that the editorial representatives of the press appreciated that, if it was accepted that the PCC could no longer continue as it had, this goal was a fundamental requirement of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  I ought to add that I initially intended to hold further seminars for different aspects of the work of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, as evidence became available, I decided that the impetus which had been the extremely valuable result of the first series of seminars did not require repetition

CLAIM sentence:  It was sufficient for public understanding of the work of the Inquiry and its direction for Counsel, Robert Jay QC, to open each module in turn, explaining precisely what it was intended to achieve and the direction that the Inquiry would take

CLAIM sentence:  That understanding was also aided by the identification and publication of key issues for each of the modules which, in turn, generated public response

CLAIM sentence:  On the one hand, I was conscious that it would create pressure on witnesses who wished to protect their privacy and, as a result of the presence of a permanent record of their evidence, could serve to undermine that privacy

CLAIM sentence:  It would also serve to increase the day to day pressure on Counsel and all others participating in the work of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, I recognised the significant public interest in what the Inquiry was doing and seeking to achieve, along with the very real importance in ensuring that the evidence was available for all to see in a form that was unmediated by press or other reporting

CLAIM sentence:  I dealt with my concern in relation to the witnesses who complained of press intrusion by ensuring that all who gave oral evidence were volunteers and understood that their evidence would be streamed on the website and available to be seen in the future; it is for that reason that I particularly recognised the value of their participation when each gave evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Although the experience of the Inquiry can inform any such debate, it is important to provide the context

CLAIM sentence:  The press and other professional witnesses were subject of notice under s of the Inquiries Act  (and so were required to provide evidence and, when appropriate, attend the Inquiry)

CLAIM sentence:  However, as I have said, the witnesses who complained about press intrusion were volunteers and understood that their evidence would be streamed and available on the website; cross examination was limited or non- existent

CLAIM sentence:  In very few cases, steps were taken to preserve anonymity of appearance if not identity

CLAIM sentence:  To film their evidence (particularly in high profile cases) would be to subject them to intolerable and damaging pressure which would most certainly not be in the interests of justice

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to eliciting responses from those who were either invited to provide evidence or, pursuant to notice under s of the Inquiries Act , were required to do so, many other interested parties and the members of the public did engage in the process of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Core Participants 

CLAIM sentence:  I decided to separate out applications for Core Participant status for each of the four modules, on the basis that although many interested parties would have equal interest in all aspects of the Inquiry (and so were granted on a blanket basis from the outset), a number might only be concerned with fewer aspects of the Terms of Reference

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, I invited applications for each of the modules and dealt with them on that basis

CLAIM sentence:  Although deadlines for such applications passed, in the  A\xcmain, I considered each, whenever it was made, on its merits and ruled in accordance with the letter and spirit of Rule () of the Inquiry Rules 

CLAIM sentence:  The sixth, and final, preliminary issue concerned the steps that I should take, while seeking to obtain a narrative of facts, to ensure that I did not prejudice any criminal investigation or potential prosecution and, at the same time, maintain a balanced and fair approach to others said to have been involved in illegal or unethical methods of gathering stories

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to the former, having invited submissions at an early stage (in particular from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police), I ruled on the appropriate approach to evidence in relation to those charged with criminal offences or under investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Fairness (as required by s() of the Inquiries Act ) has, however, taken me further for I have not felt it appropriate to protect the names of those who have been arrested from being linked to specific allegations of criminal conduct, while affording no such protection for those alleged to have been involved in other criminal (or, in some cases, unethical) conduct which is not being investigated (and therefore gives rise to no risk of prejudice)

CLAIM sentence:  This approach has been criticised by those who wish to expose what is said to be the greater criminality revealed by a study of the documents seized by the Information Commissioner during Operation Motorman (the arrest of a private detective, Steve Whittamore), involving a very much greater section of the press than those seized by the police during Operation Caryatid (the arrest of Glenn Mulcaire, now being revisited in Operation Weeting)

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is entirely consistent with the fact that the Terms of Reference are divided into two parts and that this first Part concerns the culture, practices and ethics of the press rather than individual conduct

CLAIM sentence:  To the mantra, I have added what I have called the self-denying ordinance that, although the Inquiry has investigated with individual journalists conduct which is not the subject (or likely to be the subject) of police inquiries, so that the question of self incrimination does not arise, in the main, I have extended similar protection to individual journalists and others who are not currently the subject of any investigations

CLAIM sentence:  This approach has not been inflexible because it has been critically important to ensure that an appropriate  Module  rulings: http://www

CLAIM sentence:  narrative of fact is available, against which to judge the efficacy of the present system of self regulation promulgated through the Press Complaints Commission and any proposals to amend or replace that system

CLAIM sentence:  This was not investigated further at that time but, in a masterly analysis, David Allan Green linked the reference to the exposure of a blogger known as Nightjack

CLAIM sentence:  However, because the journalist who was said to be at the centre of this incident has now been arrested for offences of computer hacking and attempting to pervert the course of justice, it is not appropriate to risk prejudice to that investigation or to any possible trial by further discussing it

CLAIM sentence:  A further consequence of this has been the need to avoid the possibility of inferential criticism of those who are currently the subject of criminal investigations

CLAIM sentence:  So, for example, a criticism of the governance arrangements at a particular newspaper, whether in general terms or directed at particular members of the management team, could, by implication, be interpreted as a criticism of others, elsewhere within the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  The requirement on me to tread this careful path might mean that some readers of this Report are surprised that a number of senior executives who gave evidence are not subject to the criticisms that might otherwise have been expected or, at least, discussed

CLAIM sentence:  It is, however, the consequence of the imperative not to or cause substantial prejudice to the investigation or prosecution of allegations of crime

CLAIM sentence:  Module One As I have explained, many public inquiries follow some incident or event which has immediately been the subject of police or other investigation, so that the product of that investigation will be able to form the basis body of evidence upon which the inquiry can rely for its facts

CLAIM sentence:  In the case of this Inquiry, however, although aspects of the Terms of Reference had been or were the subject of litigation, the police investigation was ongoing

CLAIM sentence:  Although the Inquiry obtained evidence both from the civil and public law actions, the collection of evidence even for Module One (the press and the public) required trawling from a very wide range of people including (a) individuals who complained that they have been the subject of press criminality or intrusion (one of whom gave evidence with the benefit of complete  This includes the civil actions of Gordon Taylor and Sienna Miller which were of critical importance to the greater understanding of the truth behind the assertion of one rogue reporter, the many civil actions conducted before Vos J and the public law review of the conduct of the Metropolitan Police in relation to Operation Caryatid  A\xc

CLAIM sentence:  The remaining modules required different groups of people or different individuals within the relevant organisations

CLAIM sentence:  Section () of the Inquiries Act  provides that I could require any person, within such period as appears to be reasonable to provide evidence in the form of a written statement (including documents)

CLAIM sentence:  For each module, save in relation to those who complained about press intrusion (whom I considered ought to have the opportunity to decline to give evidence in public about their complaints of invasions of privacy) and a number of the most senior politicians, I decided that all witnesses would be required pursuant to the Act to assist me: this was not intended to reflect a concern that witnesses would not be prepared to volunteer their assistance (as, I believe almost without exception, all were) but rather to ensure that there was a consistency of approach across all those whom the Inquiry approached

CLAIM sentence:  Such requests could only be made after the Inquiry had formally commenced (at the end of July ) and it was obviously essential to give everyone to whom requests for evidence had been addressed sufficient time to submit considered evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Given the summer, this meant that most of the evidence was not, in fact, available until the autumn

CLAIM sentence:  It then had to be assimilated and, eventually, made available to Core Participants for any comment prior to it being called

CLAIM sentence:  It is worth setting out the key questions posed which were as follows: The Inquiry is currently looking at the relationship between the press and the public

CLAIM sentence:  Were interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and examples in response to the specific questions below

CLAIM sentence:  Your answers may be considered as potential evidence to the inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Can you provide a personal account of culture, practices and ethics in any part of the press and media?  http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///-S-restriction-order-HJK

CLAIM sentence: pdf  This evidence included hearsay, anonymous material which Michelle Stanistreet the General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists sought to adduce from a number of journalists who feared for their careers if they spoke out in public

CLAIM sentence:  An application for this evidence to be heard was challenged by other Core Participants and subject to gateway rulings by the Inquiry: http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/ wp-content/uploads///Protocol-regarding-Applications-for-Anonymity

CLAIM sentence:  The rulings were the subject of unsuccessful challenge in the Administrative Court (Toulson LJ, Sweeney and Sharp JJ): see R (on the application of Associated Newspapers Ltd v

CLAIM sentence:  There was then a substantive ruling on the merits of the application which was granted: http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Seminar debates have suggested that commercial pressures were not new, were not unique to the press, and did not impact adversely on standards of journalism or ethical behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on this, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  Professional competition to be first or best with a story, though, could be a powerful force

CLAIM sentence:  Other participants suggested some papers put journalists under significant pressure to produce a story within a tight timeframe

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in experiences of the competitive dynamics in journalism and how that impacts on the way in which journalists operate, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The seminars also raised the issue of the casualisation of the workforce

CLAIM sentence:  The inquiry would be interested in experiences of how this may have changed the culture in newsrooms and what it might mean in terms of journalistic practice, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The issue of stories that attract a high degree of press attention but subsequently turn out to be false was raised at the seminars

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in submissions from editors, reporters and subjects of such stories - why they occur (what are the pressures that drive press interest), and how they occur (what checks and balances are or should be in place to stop this happening and why do they sometimes not operate)? 

CLAIM sentence:  One seminar attendee suggested that the National Council for the Training of Journalists does not teach ethics

CLAIM sentence:  Attendees proposed that the general law, as it applies to everyone, should be the only constraint on the press

CLAIM sentence:  The inquiry would welcome submissions on whether, and if so why, the press should be subject to any additional constraints in relation to behaviour and standards, for example relating to accuracy, treatment of vulnerable individuals, intrusion, financial reporting or reporting on crime, other than those imposed by existing laws

CLAIM sentence:  Editors at the seminars argued that the Editors Code was a good set of standards to work to

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in submissions from all parties on the coverage and substance of the Editors code including accuracy and redress for those who are affected by breaches of the code

CLAIM sentence:  Broadcasters are able to rely on the printed press to break controversial stories and then follow on behind

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard strong arguments for the importance of a free press in a democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on the special role to be played by the press in a democracy, what freedom requirements need to be  A\xcin place for that role to be played and the whether this role places any obligations or responsibilities on the press

CLAIM sentence:  Weve heard arguments that sometimes it will be in the public interest for journalists and media organisations to do things that would otherwise be ethically or legally questionable

CLAIM sentence:  The inquiry would be interested in submissions on the extent to which, if at all, should acting in the public interest be a complete or partial defence in relation to unlawful or unethical activity in pursuit of journalism; and, if so, subject to what conditions

CLAIM sentence:  In practice any public interest argument would need to be considered in the context of specific cases

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on who should be responsible for reaching decisions on whether something is in the public interest, and on what basis

CLAIM sentence:  It has been suggested that the Inquiry never engaged with the public, and therefore never engaged with those who purchase tabloid or mid-market papers, with the result that the evidence has been in some sense skewed or biased against the millions who read that type of paper

CLAIM sentence:  In fact, as discussed below, members of the public (with different interests in the work of the Inquiry) did respond to this invitation and it proved an extremely valuable resource for material which the Inquiry would not otherwise have obtained

CLAIM sentence:  Further, a number of witnesses and groups who availed themselves of the opportunity to provide views and material were later invited to attend to give evidence orally so as to develop the issues which had been raised

CLAIM sentence:  As for the risk that only those with some criticism of the press might respond, as the questions make clear, the Inquiry was equally anxious to hear in support of the press as in criticism of it

CLAIM sentence:  Witness evidence commenced on Monday  November  and, for Module One, continued until  February :  witnesses gave evidence over a period of  days and the evidence of further witnesses was read into the record of the Inquiry not only while Module One was ongoing but also, as it emerged, throughout the Inquiry and, where appropriate, even after the formal hearings had concluded

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, it was to do with factual accuracy and consequent comment

CLAIM sentence:  To that end, arrangements were made for evidence to be given from, among others, Inayat Bunglawala (Engage), Heather Harvey (Eaves Housing for Women), Anna Van Heeswijk (OBJECT), Jacqui Hunt (Equality Now), Marai Larasi (End Violence against Women) and Helen Belcher (Transmedia Watch)

CLAIM sentence:  Submissions from different groups continued to be received covering other areas of extremely important social awareness; these included, among others, submissions concerning the treatment afforded by the press to the young, the mentally ill, the disabled and other groups in society, some of which were vulnerable and others the particular subject of press concern

CLAIM sentence:  All make the same or similar points to those which the Inquiry had already heard, albeit from the different perspective of the particular concern of that specific campaign

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, I decided that it was not necessary to call more evidence; however, arrangements were made for each of these submissions (as with all other evidence read into the Inquiry) to be circulated to Core Participants so that if any advanced a reason why the evidence should not received into the record of the Inquiry, that argument could be considered

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, no objection was received and all this evidence was read into the Inquiry record

CLAIM sentence:  That means that it is published as part of the evidence of the Inquiry: I have read it and, where appropriate, included references to parts of it in this Report

CLAIM sentence:  What I am very anxious to emphasise, however, is that I do not consider that any of this evidence was second class or to be accorded a lesser status to the evidence that was adduced orally: it has all been important and it has all been considered

CLAIM sentence:  The same can be said of the submissions to the Inquiry made by others (not necessarily relating to campaigning groups concerned with third party complaints) which, having also been read into the record, has become part of the evidence in the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  As I deal with evidence that was read into the record but not called before me, I ought also to deal with complaints that were made to the Inquiry that were not adduced as evidence, not because they were not relevant to the Terms of Reference but, rather, because they were both complex and highly fact-sensitive

CLAIM sentence:  This would have resulted in a considerable amount of time being devoted to investigating the circumstances, without there being any corresponding value to be derived as to the generic culture, practices and ethics of the press (rather than the behaviour of those titles involved in the particular facts being examined)

CLAIM sentence:  Whether there should be an inquiry into this particular case is not for me to say: it is sufficient if I repeat the explanation that to have examined the issues arising would have taken weeks or months and I did not consider that the very limited time available for this Inquiry was best deployed in that way

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence touching the relationship between the press and the police had been obtained and assimilated while Module One was proceeding

CLAIM sentence:  Once again, key questions for this module were also published on the website which, again, generated considerable public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The questions (which provide a good overview of some of the issues which the Inquiry was to consider in this module) were as follows: The Inquiry is now looking at the relationship between the press and the police

CLAIM sentence:  Your answers may be considered as potential evidence to the Inquiry and may be published in a redacted form as part of the Inquirys evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police officers, other police staff, and journalists as to how the relationship between the press and the police works in practice

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would like to build up an overall picture of the nature and level of the interaction that currently exists between the police and the press

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether the Police Service governance arrangements, policies and guidance currently in place are sufficient to sustain a transparent and ethical relationship between the police and the press which at the same time upholds the confidentiality and rights of the victims of crime and the public more generally

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of journalists about whether you have ever felt under any pressure not to report a story involving a police officer or member of police staff (detailing where and from whom the pressure came), with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions from police officers, other police staff, and journalists on the extent to which formal and informal interaction between the press and the police is recorded for the purposes of transparency (are such records audited, and if so by whom, for example)

CLAIM sentence:  Information control and disclosure: 

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions on the extent to which systems are in place (and an assessment of whether they are adequate) to identify, prevent, manage and investigate police data leaks and breaches

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of the victims of crime and the public more generally, who feel that they have been adversely affected (perhaps through a data leak or breach, or through the reporting of a case) by the current relationship between the press and the police, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would also be interested to receive submissions in relation to this issue on whether it is felt that the current investigation and complaint regime are adequate to properly address instances of this type

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to what type of payments, gifts or hospitality (if any) you consider to be legitimate transactions between police officers, other police staff, and the media, and is and should the approach to payments, gifts or hospitality between the press and the police be different to the approach between the police and other parties

CLAIM sentence:  At a more specific level, Module Two covered a number of different topics

CLAIM sentence:  Second, it concerned the more general relationship over many years between the press and the MPS, thereby involving witnesses who complained about the impact of that relationship upon themselves; the last four Commissioners and the present Commissioner of the MPS, together with many very senior officers and ex officers and personnel from the Department of Public Affairs; and journalists who had considered the relationship and crime journalists who depended upon it

CLAIM sentence:  Third, evidence of comparison with other regional police forces and the regional press was called both from Chief Constables, other ranks and press departments, as was evidence of the approach of the Association of Chief Police Officers

CLAIM sentence:  Fourth, reports prepared by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary (Sir Denis OConnor) and, for the Commissioner of the MPS (by Elizabeth Filkin), and the views of police authorities (including the relevant regulator for the MPS, the Mayors Office for Policing and Crime) also fell to be considered

CLAIM sentence:  This group of seven witnesses gave evidence (over two weeks in April and May ) between Module Two concerning the press and the police and Module  concerning the press and politicians

CLAIM sentence:  Module Three formally opened on  May  and involved evidence over a period in excess of four weeks from  witnesses

CLAIM sentence:  The primary concern was the relationship between politicians of all political hues and the press, together with the impact (whether in reality or as a matter of perception) of such relationships as existed on the development and implementation of policy concerning the press

CLAIM sentence:  Although only one of a number of issues regarding the relationship between politicians and the proprietors and editors of mass market newspapers over the last  years, the questions that arose (being of contemporary political concern) came to dominate aspects of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  There was particular interest in an issue arising from Parliamentary Questions addressed to the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, which were the subject  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach of a detailed account in his statement to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, these Parliamentary Questions were not then pursued in the House of Commons; they were examined, at some length, when Jeremy Hunt MP gave evidence

CLAIM sentence:  This module continued until  June , although aspects were further examined on - June

CLAIM sentence:  As with the first two modules, key questions regarding the relationship between the press and politicians were identified and placed on the website for consideration and comment by any interested group or member of the public

CLAIM sentence:  Again, it provides useful context for the work of the Inquiry to set these questions out at this stage: The Inquiry is now looking at the relationship between the press and politicians

CLAIM sentence:  We are interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and examples in response to the specific questions below

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry is interested in the extent of public knowledge and understanding of the relationship between the media and the politicians

CLAIM sentence:  All meetings with newspaper and other media proprietors, editors and senior executives will be published quarterly, regardless of the purpose of the meeting

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would like to hear views on the specific benefits and risks to the public interest arising from relationships between senior politicians, at a national level, and the media

CLAIM sentence:  What does the public stand to gain from this relationship? What does it stand to lose? How can the gains be maximised and the risks minimised? Are there specific considerations the Inquiry should be aware of in the run up to general elections and other national polls? 

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry is interested in hearings views on the conditions that are necessary for a free press in a democracy to fulfil its role in holding politicians and the powerful to account

CLAIM sentence:  What is the nature of that role? What is the public entitled to expect of the press in fulfilling it? How can the public see for itself that the press is taking this role seriously and going about it responsibly? Are there some good examples? 

CLAIM sentence:  Is there a perception that political journalism generally has moved from reporting, to seeking to make or influence political events? How far is there evidence for that, and should it be a matter of public concern or not? Does the press have a legitimate function in fulfilling a political Opposition role? 

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry is interested in the nature of media influence on public policy in general (for example in areas such as criminal justice, immigration or European policy)

CLAIM sentence:  Do you have views, or any specific examples, about how that influence is exercised and with what effect? How transparent is the process? Is the public well served by it?  pp-, lines -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  As I have made consistently clear, my approach has been focussed on the relationship between the press and politicians and the conduct of each as a matter of generality; it is no part of my intention or my function to pass judgment on anything else and, in particular, I have not addressed the political (still less the party political) questions that have been asked  http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Is there evidence of media influence on public and political appointments (including the tenure and termination of those appointments)? The Inquiry is interested in examples, including of cases where the public interest was, and was not, well served by such influence

CLAIM sentence:  How far do you think politicians feel inhibited from acting in the public interest to ensure that the medias conduct, practices and ethics are themselves in the public interest? Why might that be? What would make a difference? Module Four 

CLAIM sentence:  This module was initially described as involving a discussion of emerging findings

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, it was clear that the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF) and the current chair of the PCC had embarked upon the process of re-casting self-regulation; this Module therefore consisted of a detailed examination not only of that model but also a substantial number of other models for the regulation of the press that had been submitted as evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  To encourage that process and assist those devising potential solutions to the problems of press regulation, the Inquiry published Draft Criteria for an Effective Regulatory Regime

CLAIM sentence:  These were not intended to be definitive but merely illustrative of the issues that had to be addressed

CLAIM sentence:  These criteria were as follows: In module  the Inquiry will hear proposals for potential press regulatory solutions

CLAIM sentence:  The detailed rules would be dealt with in the substance of any code or regulations

CLAIM sentence:  These three aspects of a regulatory regime need to be considered separately as they are not necessarily dependent on each other and it may be possible to achieve the desired objectives by different combinations of solutions

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has already heard a number of suggestions in relation to the how and the purpose of module  is to look at those suggestions in more detail

CLAIM sentence:  In order to facilitate the scrutiny of the how proposals it is necessary to understand what any regulatory solution is seeking to achieve

CLAIM sentence:  The draft criteria for a regulatory solution below set out the criteria against which the Inquiry proposes to measure potential regulatory solutions

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Draft-Criteria-for-a-Regulatory-Solution

CLAIM sentence:  Any solution must be perceived as effective and credible both by the press as an industry and by the public: (a) It must strike a balance, capable of being accepted as reasonable, legitimate and in the public interest by all

CLAIM sentence:  (b) It must recognise the importance for the public interest of a free press in a democracy, freedom of expression and investigative journalism, the rule of law, personal privacy and other private rights, and a press which acts responsibly and in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  (c) It must promote a clear understanding of the public interest which would be accepted as reasonable by press, industry and public alike

CLAIM sentence:  (d) It must be durable and sufficiently flexible to work for future markets and technology, and be capable of universal application

CLAIM sentence:  There must be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable by the industry and credible by the public

CLAIM sentence:  This statement must identify enforceable minimum standards as well as articulating good practice that should be aimed for

CLAIM sentence:  All standards for good practice in journalism should be driven by the public interest and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The setting of standards must be independent of government and parliament, and sufficiently independent of media interests, in order to command public respect

CLAIM sentence:  Independence and transparency of enforcement and compliance 

CLAIM sentence:  Enforcement of ethical standards, by whatever mechanism, must be operationally independent of government and parliament, and sufficiently independent of media interests, in order to command public respect

CLAIM sentence:  In particular all relevant appointments processes must be sufficiently independent of government, Parliament and media interests to command public support

CLAIM sentence:  Compliance must be the responsibility of editors and transparent and demonstrable to the public

CLAIM sentence:  The system must provide credible remedies, both in respect of aggrieved individuals and in respect of issues affecting wider groups in society

CLAIM sentence:  The regulatory regime must have effective investigatory and advisory powers

CLAIM sentence:  The system should also actively support and promote compliance by the industry, both directly (for example by providing confidential pre-publication advice) and indirectly (for example by kitemarking titles own internal systems)

CLAIM sentence:  Quite apart from the regulatory solution, Module Four also dealt with other key questions and, to that end, involved evidence from experts in diverse fields ranging from differing approaches to press regulation across the word (and, in particular, the Irish model) to data protection, from ethics and philosophy to plurality

CLAIM sentence:  The key questions, reflecting some of these issues, were published on the website and, again, interested parties and the public were invited to submit evidence which could be considered during the course of the evidence (even if only to prompt questions from Counsel to the Inquiry)

CLAIM sentence:  These questions were as follows: Relevant aspects of the public interest 

CLAIM sentence:  How would you describe the public interest in freedom of expression? To what extent does that public interest coincide with, or diverge from, the public interest in a free press? 

CLAIM sentence:  In order to maximise the overall public interest, with what other aspects of the public interest would freedom of expression, or freedom of the press, have to be balanced or limited? The Inquiry is particularly interested in the following, but there may be others: (a) the interest of the public as a whole in good political governance, for example in areas such as national security, public order and economic wellbeing, the rule of law, the proper independence and accountability of law enforcement agencies, and access to justice, and the democratic accountability of government for the formation and implementation of policy; (b) the public interest in individual self-determination and the protection and enforcement of private interests, for example privacy, including (but not necessarily limited to) the rights to privacy specified in general in Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights and in European and national legislation on the protection of personal data, confidentiality, the protection of reputation, and intellectual and other property rights, and individual freedom of expression and rights to receive and impart information where those interests and rights are not identical to the interests and rights of the press

CLAIM sentence:  What are your views on the extent to which the overall public interest is currently well served, both in principle and in practice, by the current balance between the public interest in the freedom of the press and free expression on the one hand, and competing aspects of the public interest on the other? In your opinion, what  http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, to whom might the press be considered to owe ethical duties, and why? What might be the content of such duties? To what extent might such duties come into conflict, and how should any such conflicts be resolved? The Inquiry is particularly interested in the following as potentially owed ethical duties, but there may be others: (a) readers and consumers of the media (b) persons who are the subject matter of stories and other media products (c) the wider public (d) employees, journalists and other producers of the media (e) shareholders, investors, advertisers and others with an economic interest in the media

CLAIM sentence:  What approach would you recommend to the consideration of improvement to the nature, status, content and enforceability of the current Code? Are there changes to either content or enforceability of the current Code you would wish to see? Please explain your thinking

CLAIM sentence:  What other changes would you consider desirable in order to encourage or constrain the press to improved standards of ethical conduct and practice? Your answer should explain the standards you consider appropriate and why, whether conformity should be encouraged or constrained, and how

CLAIM sentence:  In other words, subject to the over-riding control of the court, the parties to the litigation define the issues and the evidence to be adduced, each side disclosing the evidence on which it is intended to rely and calling such witnesses as it feels necessary to prove its case

CLAIM sentence:  Witnesses called by one side are cross-examined by the other side or sides, challenging evidence which is disputed and putting the case which is to be advanced so that the witness can deal with the allegations made against him or her

CLAIM sentence:  The role of the judge or tribunal is to stand in the middle of the exercise, intervening in the evidence to elucidate or seek explanation and then listen to the opposing arguments of the parties both as to the facts and the law, before ultimately deciding the issues at stake

CLAIM sentence:  Inquisitorial proceedings (more common in civil law than common law jurisdictions) are led by the judge or tribunal and involve active participation the investigation  A\xcof the facts

CLAIM sentence:  There will still be an important role for the legal representatives of the parties to ensure that their case is fully considered

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of an Inquiry is not to resolve issues between parties to litigation; there are no parties and there is no litigation in place

CLAIM sentence:  On more than one occasion, it has appeared that at least one Core Participant has treated itself as if in adversarial litigation with the Inquiry but that is to misunderstand both the Inquiry and the role of those who participate in it

CLAIM sentence:  The role of the Core Participants has been to assist the Inquiry in the elucidation of the facts which form the substratum of the Terms of Reference and then to make submissions on the way forward

CLAIM sentence:  He said [] EWHC  (Admin) at para : The purpose of the Inquiry is not to vindicate individuals sufferings or claims they may have due to mistreatment by the press, but rather for all of us as citizens concerned at the relations between the press, institutions and the public

CLAIM sentence:  The role of Core Participants is, therefore, totally different to that of the parties to litigation and very much more constrained than the role that might be adopted even in inquisitorial proceedings which are directed to dealing with individual complaints or claims

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, Rule  of the Inquiry Rules  is in these terms: () Subject to paragraphs () to (), where a witness is giving oral evidence at an inquiry hearing, only counsel to the inquiry 

CLAIM sentence:  and the inquiry panel may ask the witness questions

CLAIM sentence:  () Where a witness, whether a core participant or otherwise, has been questioned orally in the course of an inquiry hearing pursuant to paragraph (), the chairman may direct that the recognised legal representative of that witness may ask the witness questions

CLAIM sentence:  () The recognised legal representative of a core participant may apply to the chairman for permission to ask questions of a witness giving oral evidence

CLAIM sentence:  () When making an application under paragraphs () or (), the recognised legal representative must state (a) the issues in respect of which a witness is to be questioned; and (b) whether the questioning will raise new issues or, if not, why the questioning should be permitted

CLAIM sentence:  As early as  September , I raised this provision and the potential consequences of it, observing that given the pressure on the Inquiry, subject to submissions, I may well require  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach issues which Core Participants wished to raise to be discussed with Counsel to the Inquiry in the first instance; he would then be able to conduct such cross-examination as he believed appropriate and, at the same time, restrict other cross-examination

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example, although Core Participants for affected newspapers suggested questions and lines of enquiry in relation to those who complained that they had been the victims of illegal or unethical press attention (and many of these were pursued by Counsel to the Inquiry when the witnesses gave evidence), I did not permit these witnesses to be cross examined in a manner that could have been appropriate in civil proceedings: I was not prepared to allow them potentially to be victimised again simply because they wished to complain about what had happened to them

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, not only did I prevent cross examination by Core Participants of journalists and others in relation to the subject matter of criminal investigation; subject to specific exceptions and the requirements of fairness enshrined in s() of the Inquiries Act , neither did I generally permit it in relation to other allegations of illegal or unethical conduct

CLAIM sentence:  That is not to say that the evidence has not been probed: that is the role that Counsel to the Inquiry has undertaken with rigour but always with an eye to the Terms of Reference in general and addressing the culture, practices and ethics of the press in particular

CLAIM sentence:  Notwithstanding the general approach, however, some aspects of the evidence have been subject to detailed examination

CLAIM sentence:  Findings of fact Although the constraints relating to the examination of witnesses are written into the statute and thus have bound me, I would not want it to be thought that I considered them to be inappropriate or inimical to the interests of justice in this particular Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Had the procedure been otherwise, this Inquiry need never have finished

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to the press and the public, the Inquiry has not only looked at the historical position but has traversed over  years of journalistic activity

CLAIM sentence:  Hundreds of complaints have been made and, although there is no issue about many, a lot more have been the subject of challenge (to greater or lesser effect) and could have given rise to detailed factual investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Those few stories that have been investigated in depth inevitably took a great deal of time: had it been necessary for each one, the time taken would have been inordinate

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the Inquiry covered far more than the press and the public

CLAIM sentence:  The relationship between the press and the police covered the tenure of no fewer than five Commissioners of Police for the Metropolis and crossed all national titles

CLAIM sentence:  Other forces, their press offices and local papers were also the subject of evidence

CLAIM sentence:  As for the relationship between press and politicians, in the same way that time was devoted to the bid by News Corp for the remaining shares in BSkyB Ltd, so many dominating political stories (from Iraq to the Euro) have been subject to rigorous and detailed analysis

CLAIM sentence: pdf  This is one of the reasons why, given the concessions that were made by the press Core Participants, it was inappropriate to investigate the detail contained in the books seized from Steve Whittamore during Operation Motorman

CLAIM sentence:  The same is said for the development of press handling by the Government over the last  years

CLAIM sentence:  The effect, however, would have been an Inquiry that would have taken many years, by the end of which time the specific concerns which brought about the Inquiry in the first place (and, in particular, the issue of the regulation of the press) would have remained unaddressed, other than in whatever way the press chose themselves to address them in the meantime

CLAIM sentence:  That was not the brief that was contained within Part  of the Terms of Reference and it is not how I have sought to address them

CLAIM sentence:  This means that a large number of specific individual incidents have not been the subject of very detailed factual investigation so that, subject to very limited exceptions, I do not feel in a position to make findings of fact as to what did and did not occur; neither, for the purposes of addressing the Terms of Reference is it necessary that I do so

CLAIM sentence:  During the Labour Party conference, it decided to make public a change in allegiance and thereafter to support the Conservative Party

CLAIM sentence:  It has been suggested that it is important that I resolve this conflict of evidence and express my view as to where the truth lies

CLAIM sentence:  The first is very important in the context of the nature of the Inquiry and the manner in which it has had to be approached both as a matter of statute but also, as I have indicated, practicality

CLAIM sentence:  I recognise that judges are sometimes required to make difficult factual decisions with very little more than the information available and, if it was critical to do so, I would have had to do the best that I could

CLAIM sentence:  That leads me to the second reason

CLAIM sentence:  In part, I have gone into the detail of this particular factual conflict because of the interest and concern that has been expressed about it

CLAIM sentence:  Of greater importance as a reason for doing so has been to explain the limitations of the forensic exercise that it has been possible to undertake while addressing the very wide Terms of Reference within the broad timeframe within which I have been asked to report

CLAIM sentence:  This Report will not provide all the answers to all the questions that could possibly arise out of the uncountable number of issues that have been raised in evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Those who are expecting it to do so will be disappointed

CLAIM sentence:  The material which can fall to be used by the Inquiry is not, however, limited to the statements that have been put into evidence

CLAIM sentence:  It has fallen to me to determine what should be part of that record; I have deliberately adopted as wide a definition of relevance as possible, in order to ensure that as full a picture of the culture, practices and ethics of the press can be put into the public domain by the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  In that way, the public can itself make a collective decision based on the same material that has been available to me

CLAIM sentence:  Free speech requires no less and although I have occasionally raised concerns about factual accuracy, I stand fully behind the freedom of the press to comment critically about me, my approach, the evidence and any other aspect of the Inquiry that it sees fit to write about

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, in addition to the other evidence that has been read into the record of the Inquiry, I also decided that the product of a press cuttings service dealing with the Inquiry should also be read into the record

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has not been alone in commenting on the way in which the press have reported the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Private Eye has regularly published commentary on the way in which it has been reported; the campaign (on the website http://hackinginquiry

CLAIM sentence: org/) has done the same

CLAIM sentence:  Bloggers have added their own comment and the Inquiry has engaged with Twitter (http:// twitter

CLAIM sentence: com/@levesoninquiry) on which there has been a regular and substantial dialogue about the Inquiry both in this country and abroad

CLAIM sentence:  This also is a very powerful example of the proper manifestation of free speech

CLAIM sentence:  On more than one occasion, it was necessary to deal with disclosure of information that had been shared with Core Participants in advance of its publication: these were highly relevant during the course of the hearings but are now unnecessary further to rehearse

CLAIM sentence:  Submissions have also been received dealing with issues of evidence, on the approach to Rule  of the Inquiry Rules  and in relation to the standard of proof, the last two of which I deal with below

CLAIM sentence:  Submissions have generally in writing and supplemented orally; all are also published on the website so that it is possible to see the entirety of the argument put before me as well as the ruling that followed

CLAIM sentence:  Final submissions on various aspects of the Inquiry have also been received following the conclusion of the various modules

CLAIM sentence:  In the main, they have been extremely thorough, very detailed and, as a consequence, extremely lengthy

CLAIM sentence:  They have clearly been the product of an enormous amount of work and I am grateful for the effort and very great care that has been put into them

CLAIM sentence:  The fact that some arguments and submissions have not been specifically addressed in this Report is not intended as a discourtesy either to the writers or to the arguments

CLAIM sentence:  Inevitably, this Report has had to focus on the Terms of Reference, whereas the relevant Core Participants have understandably cast their nets rather wider in order to deal both with the generality and the specifics of some of the issues that have been raised to such extent as they affect them

CLAIM sentence:  Although it was always anticipated that it could be necessary to re-convene the Inquiry, to obtain updated information in relation to the police investigations and to receive any other important evidence that had emerged following the conclusion of the hearings in July , written and oral closing submissions were invited and presented by most (but not all) of the Core Participants

CLAIM sentence: pdf; and the analysis of the circumstances in which a newspaper published material which had been contained in a statement provided for the Inquiry: http://www

CLAIM sentence:  For the avoidance of all doubt, the purpose of these orders and rulings were to preserve the integrity of the Inquiry: I do not consider that any of the concerns which are analysed should contribute to the conclusions that I have to reach about the culture, practices or ethics of the press  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach course of the consideration of the regulatory regime, although I shall be doing so from the perspective of the press as opposed to the extent to which individual titles have behaved in such a way as requires a different approach to regulation

CLAIM sentence:  I saw no value in Counsel to the Inquiry making a closing submission and he did not do so

CLAIM sentence:  Before turning to the issues of law that have had to be considered as part of the Report writing process, I return to the website because it is appropriate to say something more about the way in which the Inquiry has sought to involve the public in its process and ensure that the evidence which has been given has received the widest audience

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose was to engage with as wide a reach of members of the public as possible and to obtain as wide a range of views as possible

CLAIM sentence:  The extent of that response can be judged from Appendix B which sets out a detailed record of the type and number of communications received by the Inquiry through the general mailbox or otherwise

CLAIM sentence:  Although I recognise that a number of those who wrote will have been disappointed that they were not given the opportunity to give oral evidence, I explicitly recognise and pay tribute to the very hard work that has been put into ensuring that all the observations have been received have been acted upon appropriately

CLAIM sentence:  Appendix B also identifies the number of times up to the end of October  that the Inquiry website has been accessed along with its reach

CLAIM sentence:  I believe that the Inquiry has done as much as could reasonably have been expected to engage with the public would be surprised if any public inquiry has achieved as much public access

CLAIM sentence:  I have no doubt that this has all contributed to the public reaction to events and the further debate as to the way forward

CLAIM sentence:  Prior to the publication of any Report which includes explicit or significant criticism of any person, the Inquiry Rules  mandate that such a person must be warned of that criticism and given a reasonable opportunity to respond

CLAIM sentence:  I set out the background and the legal framework in a ruling on the Application of Rule  which I can do no better than repeat: 

CLAIM sentence:  One of the touchstones of the inquisitorial process prescribed by the  [Inquiries] Act is the requirement of fairness to all

CLAIM sentence:  Whereas s

CLAIM sentence:  () of the Act provides that the procedure and conduct of the Inquiry shall be such as I direct, that provision is subject to s

CLAIM sentence:  () in these terms: In making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry, the chairman must act with fairness and with regard to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost (whether to public funds or to witnesses or others)

CLAIM sentence:  No higher manifestation of that duty is apparent than that which deals with the requirement that those who may be criticised in any report have the opportunity afforded to them to deal with the basis of that criticism

CLAIM sentence:  The next manifestation of this requirement (described as fair play in action by Sachs LJ in Re Pergamon Press Ltd [] Ch  at ) dealt with comment on proposed criticism

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment they are no more bound to tell a witness likely to be criticised in their report what they have in mind to say about him than has a judge sitting alone who has to decide which of two conflicting witnesses is telling the truth

CLAIM sentence:  The judge must ensure that the witness whose credibility is suspected has a fair opportunity of correcting or contradicting the substance of what other witnesses have said or are expected to say which is in conflict with his testimony

CLAIM sentence:  Inspectors should do the same but I can see no reason why they should do any more

CLAIM sentence:  The  Act (pursuant to which this Inquiry is being conducted) adopts a different and, in my judgment, self-contained approach to ensure fairness

CLAIM sentence:   of the Act provides that I may by notice require any person to provide evidence in the form of a written statement along with documents

CLAIM sentence:  Such notices have identified, in comprehensive terms, the issues with which the statement has been required to deal; where appropriate, it has identified relevant documents or other public statements which should be addressed

CLAIM sentence:  It cannot, of course, deal with evidence not then seen by the Inquiry but where issues of significance have arisen before the witness arrives, forewarning has been given and, if necessary, witnesses allowed time to deal with a matter for which they were not prepared

CLAIM sentence:  Where the issue has arisen only after the witness has given evidence, again if it is significant, second statements have been requested and obtained; more than one witness has been required to return to give further evidence

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to Rule , therefore, I concluded that a warning addressed to a section of the press consisting of the national titles (even if a number of those have not been the subject of criticism or complaint) allowed each to make submissions as to the conclusions that I should draw as to the culture, practices and ethics of the press generally (as opposed to the specific conduct of individual titles although it has been made clear titles have been free to comment on stories which are identifiably referable to them)

CLAIM sentence:  I went on to conclude not only that generic criticisms should be evidence based, but that the justification for my concerns should be visible and capable of being understood both by those affected and by the public

CLAIM sentence:  Conscious that any approach to Rule  was likely to be contentious, I arranged for the matter to be argued in principle and ruled on the approach generally

CLAIM sentence:  I have, however, issued Rule  warnings to individuals (and others concerned with the relationship between the press and the public) in those circumstances where I thought fairness warranted it and, in particular, when I was concerned that any conclusion that I might reach in relation to a specific incident could be said to contain an express or implied criticism of them

CLAIM sentence:  The touchstone has been to provide an opportunity to make representations about identifiable concerns that I was proposing to express

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, it is important that I emphasise that this Report should not be read as addressing the individual conduct of members of the press in their dealings with the public and no implied criticism should be read into the fact that references to particular complaints are inevitably to particular stories written by identifiable journalists (albeit not named in the text of the Report)

CLAIM sentence:  I cannot repeat too often that this part of the Inquiry is not concerned with individual conduct but with the culture, practices and ethics of the press (or a section of the press) as a whole

CLAIM sentence:  Who would be to blame for a particular egregious story? Would it be a proprietor or editor who ordained a particular approach or a particular agenda? Would it be the journalist who felt driven to do what had been bidden irrespective of personal qualms? Would it be the sub-editor who wrote a headline that misrepresented what should be derived from correctly identified facts or modified the words of caution that the journalist had carefully included? How could I decide between these cumulative or alternative possibilities? In the circumstances, I have only been able to take the story at face value along with the reaction of the subject of the story and my view of the law (for example in relation to privacy) and the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  The result of this analysis is that, in relation to most of the complaints made by those who have been subject to press intrusion I have not issued Rule  letters

CLAIM sentence:  This is because I do not intend either expressly or by implication to make explicit or significant criticism of the relevant journalists (rather than, generically, of the press)

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, if, in any particular case or in relation to any particular example that I wish to highlight, I have been in doubt, I have issued a warning and provided an opportunity for representations to be made

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, I received detailed submissions from Counsel for the MPS both generally and specifically as to the interaction of Parts  and  of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Again, I have followed it and issued Rule  letters both general and specific in nature, taking full account of the representations that I have received

CLAIM sentence:  Module Three raised different issues for a number of reasons

CLAIM sentence:  First, there is no criminal investigation that could affect my approach and, in addition, it does not appear that there will be any other consideration of the general issues which I have to address in the Terms of Reference; that might be thought to be a basis for encouraging me to range further and wider than in relation to the other modules

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, the Terms of Reference are specific to the culture, practices and ethics of the press including contacts and the relationships between national newspapers and politicians, and the conduct of each

CLAIM sentence:  It is argued that the Inquiry should investigate the nature of friendships between individual members of the press and individual politicians but, save to the extent that these bite or may bite upon the way in which a journalist (or politician) attend to his or her professional duties, it does not appear to me that it is necessary or appropriate for me to enquire

CLAIM sentence:  For me to express that conclusion, however, undeniably constitutes an explicit or significant criticism in respect of which I must issue a Rule  letter

CLAIM sentence:  Such a criticism, however, is not intended to be personal but generic

CLAIM sentence:  It recognises that how close is too close is itself a very difficult and nuanced issue, given that it is critically important, in a democratic society, that politicians engage with the press and seek to explain their policies to the public through the press

CLAIM sentence:  I made it clear that I would not opine on the Ministerial Code or seek to prevent Parliament from investigating whatever aspect of the bid it wished to investigate; however, I recognise that it constitutes the most recent and most well documented inter-reaction between a very powerful media organisation and politicians (although the interaction in relation to the legislative proposals now contained in s- of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act  which has not yet been implemented are also important)

CLAIM sentence:  I have, therefore, attempted to analyse these issues from a general, cultural perspective: the process has inevitably involved a consideration of individual decisions and, on the basis that, even if not explicit, implied significant criticism may be inferred, I have issued appropriate warnings accordingly

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that they should be, not least because, from the outset of the Inquiry and throughout, I encouraged the press to put forward their own ideas for press regulation, bearing in mind not only the values which it held to be important but also the interests of the public as demonstrated not only by the demand for this Inquiry but also by the evidence which has been given to it

CLAIM sentence:  The first is the fact that a notice is only necessary to address potential criticism: it is not intended to present a balanced picture of any sort

CLAIM sentence:  The point was clear from the body of the letter which explained: By definition, this letter is focussed on the aspects of the culture, practices and ethics of the press which may attract criticism and it is not the function of this letter to refer to the evidence of good culture, practice and ethics which the Inquiry has received

CLAIM sentence:  The second consequence flows from the first

CLAIM sentence:  A possible criticism should not be interpreted as one that will inevitably be made

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, the letter also made it clear that both it and any response were subject to a legal duty of confidence owed in the public interest under Rule ()(b) of the Inquiry Rules 

CLAIM sentence:  This requirement (expressly mandated in the Rules) is specifically designed to discourage public discussion or debate about criticisms which have not yet been made and which could well, in the end, be less serious

CLAIM sentence:  It was and is, therefore, a demonstrable attempt to be fair and to provide an opportunity to those who might be affected to make submissions about possible criticism at a time when, as I made clear, I was continuing to reflect on the narrative and conclusions which I would reach and before I had done so

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, although it has been portrayed as such, the letter is not intended to be a secret: it is only confidential until the Report is signed or published, after which time anyone is free to discuss the letters, criticise their content and analyse the extent to which my views might have changed

CLAIM sentence:  My concluded view, as expressed in the Report, will then be available

CLAIM sentence:   This obligation of confidence is owed by the Inquiry team to any recipient of the letter and by that recipient to me, as Chairman of the Inquiry: see para

CLAIM sentence:  () of the Inquiry Rules   The obligation ceases, as far as I am concerned, when I sign the Report and, so far as everyone else is concerned, when the Report is published: see para

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore not in the least surprising that the letters are one-sided, that the positive should not be subject to a similar letter, or that I would be concerned if the contents were being openly discussed in the press

CLAIM sentence:  All are, of course, entitled to express whatever view they wish about the summary of press practice that can be culled from the evidence but it is worth repeating (not for the first, or the last, time) that the criticisms that I have suggested were not directed at the entirety of the press: most journalists, most if not all the time, do not behave in the way that, on my assessment of the evidence, a small but not insignificant number have behaved, thereby generating criticism of the culture that permitted this to happen, the practices involved and the ethics of those who have behaved in that way

CLAIM sentence:  A number of recipients of Rule  letters have questioned the fairness of the process on various grounds, and I should record that I have considered these objections and submissions with great care, always in the context of my ultimate obligation under section  of the Inquiries Act to act fairly

CLAIM sentence:  I am completely satisfied that all recipients who have chosen to submit substantive responses have understood the issues in respect of which I have sought further assistance, and have addressed them in appropriate detail

CLAIM sentence:  In the few instances where it appeared that recipients might have misunderstood the point that I wished them to have the opportunity to address, I have provided further explanation and given them that opportunity

CLAIM sentence:  In the result, many of my provisional conclusions have been revised or reformulated to reflect the Rule  process and the representations that I have received

CLAIM sentence:  The starting point for any consideration of the nature of what must be proved and the standard of proof is, from the outset, to recognise that the Inquiry has been set up specifically because particular events have caused 

CLAIM sentence:  public concern

CLAIM sentence:  To some extent, it is sufficient simply to refer back to the Terms of Reference of Part  of the Inquiry but, summarising at least the most important of these events, it would be appropriate to include as topics about which I have been required to inquire: (a) (b) (c) (d) the disclosure of the interception of Milly Dowlers mobile phone messages and the deletion of such messages; the fact that it was common ground that the News of the World had engaged in interception of mobile phone messages (revealed in civil litigation and otherwise) contrary to the continued assertion that Clive Goodman was one rogue reporter; other complaints of illegal or unethical methods by which journalists obtained stories (not the least significant being activity in breach of Data Protection legislation leading to a concern about the policy, operation and effectiveness of the regulatory regime for data protection); the harassment and pressure placed both on members of the public caught up in stories attracting enormous press coverage and those in the public eye whether because of  Writing in the Observer on  September  (http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/media//sep//simon-fox-trinity- music-man-record?INTCMP=SRCH) , Peter Preston said that I was spraying a confidential -page letter of early criticisms around Fleet Street which had been described as a diatribe, a completely one-sided attack that resembles loading a gun and excoriating

CLAIM sentence:  He suggested that my disappointment that my comments were being openly discussed in the press was an indication that he still doesnt quite get it so that he suffers just disappointment if it doesnt leak instantly

CLAIM sentence:  It might also simply demonstrate that not enough care has been taken to understand the process and to comply with sensible obligations specifically designed to be fair to all  s() of the Inquiries Act   A\xc(e) (f) (g) (h) their celebrity or otherwise; the failure of the Press Complaints Commission to address the activities of the News of the World (save only to exonerate them and criticise The Guardian for its reporting); to provide adequate regulatory oversight in relation to the press; to provide adequate redress for those complaining of press misconduct save in limited circumstances; and to ensure that its remit embraced the press as a whole; the nature of the relationship between the press and the police and, in particular, the extent to which failure of the police properly to investigate the extent of interception of mobile phone messages was a consequence of that relationship; the way in which politicians engaged with the press and, in particular, the extent to which the commercial interests of the press influenced the development or implementation of policy, along with the failure to address prior concerns over many years relating to media misconduct; and the impact of the plurality of the media and cross media ownership on the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  More important than the topics about which I am required to inquire are the subjects about which I am required to make recommendations

CLAIM sentence:  It is sufficient to repeat the Terms of Reference which are expressed in this way: To make recommendations: (a) for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime which supports the integrity and freedom of the press, the plurality of the media, and its independence, including from Government, while encouraging the highest ethical and professional standards; (b) for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and cross-media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities, including Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police; (c) the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press; and (d) the future conduct of relations between the police and the press

CLAIM sentence:  Part  is a quantitative exercise: how extensive have been the identified failures in News International, other press organisations, the police, the political class, public servants or others? On that basis, the implications (and any additional recommendations fall to be addressed

CLAIM sentence:  The report may also contain anything else that the panel considers to be relevant to the terms of reference (including any recommendations the panel sees fit to make despite not being required to do so by the terms of reference)

CLAIM sentence:  The facts as determined, however, are those which are necessary in order to provide the context for the recommendations

CLAIM sentence:  Focussing on the relationship between the press and the public, therefore, the submission that a single or occasional instance of misconduct will not itself justify any adverse finding about the culture, practices or ethics of the press is to proceed on the mistaken basis of thinking quantitatively rather than qualitatively

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to the future of regulation, the question whether a new regime is appropriate must be asked by reference to how the present regulatory regime has dealt with such issues as have arisen and whether it retains public confidence

CLAIM sentence:  If problems with or concerns about the culture, practices and ethics of the press are represented by a single or occasional example it may not be appropriate or necessary to recommend any change

CLAIM sentence:  Nobody, however, has submitted that this is the case

CLAIM sentence:  It is not challenged that there is legitimate public concern about the regulatory regime which it is no longer suggested is fit for purpose; the issue is the extent of that problem and the benefits and detriments of possible solutions

CLAIM sentence:  Neither does it matter that any problem is limited to one or a small number of titles

CLAIM sentence:  A regulatory regime must deal with all titles and be in a position appropriately to deal with even a single recalcitrant paper; it is irrelevant if one or more title never attracts its adverse attention

CLAIM sentence:  The reason for the exception is so that the public do not ascribe to other titles the many criticisms that have been articulated about that one

CLAIM sentence:  What I sought from all Core Participants (but have not always received) was an analysis of the extent to which, as a matter of generality, there was a problem with the culture, practices and ethics of the press or a section of the press, so that it would be possible to consider a new and sufficiently robust policy and regulatory regime which supports the integrity and freedom of the press but also reflects the legitimate rights of others

CLAIM sentence:  In argument, it has been submitted that it is appropriate for the Inquiry to express its findings at a high level of generality

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, the problem of intrusion on grief identified by certain  s() of the Inquiries Act   s() and () of the Inquiries Act   A\xc

CLAIM sentence:  witnesses is a problem of conduct by at least part of the press and it matters not for the purpose of making recommendations whether it occurred only at one title, at several titles, or at all titles

CLAIM sentence:  From this perspective the Inquiry can find that there are concerns about alleged press misconduct without determining whether the particular type of misconduct occurred on one occasion or one hundred, at one title or many

CLAIM sentence:  I have already concluded, however, that a single or occasional instance of misconduct may not be sufficient to justify an adverse finding about culture, practices and ethics on the basis that it is of no real significance

CLAIM sentence:  That is not to say that I will not deal with individual cases because worked examples can exemplify the problems that exist even in titles that are not the subject of repeated complaint and these may add to the overall picture

CLAIM sentence:  As a consequence, it is important to underline that it is not an inevitable inference that the culture, practices and ethics of the title affected is driven by the problem that I am exemplifying

CLAIM sentence:  Against that background, a consideration of the standard of proof becomes much more straightforward

CLAIM sentence:  I accept that the public interest requires that the findings of the Inquiry are expressed in such a way that can readily be understood to be a judgment on what has occurred and why any recommendations have been made and, furthermore, that the appropriate standard is that applicable in all but criminal cases, namely the balance of probability

CLAIM sentence:  To put it more colloquially, before reaching a conclusion, for example, that an event has happened, I must conclude that its occurrence is more likely than not

CLAIM sentence:  I further recognise both from an analysis of Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) and the subsequent decisions of R(N) v Mental Health Review Tribunal (Northern Region) and Re D that the application of the balance of probabilities is flexible in its application in that the more serious the allegation, the more careful the analysis of the facts will have to be not least because of the reduced likelihood of it being true

CLAIM sentence:  In my ruling in relation to the application of Rule  of the Inquiry Rules , I raised the question whether it was sufficient that I consider whether the evidence reveals such a concern about particular conduct that regulatory arrangements should be put in place to deal with that type of behaviour should it arise

CLAIM sentence:  The relevance of the concept of inherent improbability to a determination of whether an event took place (as opposed to who was responsible) has recently been re-affirmed in Re S-B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) []  AC  per Baroness Hale of Richmond at para -  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  He recognised that such a comment would not be a finding of fact and that the power so to conclude should be exercised sparingly

CLAIM sentence:  I accept that unresolved suspicions, on their own, do not provide a sufficient basis for conclusions, in particular as to the success or otherwise of the present regulatory regime but the words on their own are important

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example, I can conclude without difficulty that mobile phone interception was far more extensive at the NoTW than was initially admitted and I can also be satisfied that knowledge of the technique was far more widespread than the confines of the NoTW but, until the Guardian article in , it was not addressed by the press or the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  That alone is likely to be sufficient to justify a new approach to regulation but it seems to me that I can (and should) be able to go much further

CLAIM sentence:  The effect of the argument that to do so offends my general approach is that I would not be able to reach any conclusion because to criticise any individual title or group is to criticise the editor

CLAIM sentence:  This is no more than a repetition of the argument that I rejected in the ruling on Rule  concerning the implied criticism of those involved which was not thereafter challenged

CLAIM sentence:  I am certainly prepared to accept, however, that I should not criticise any individual by name unless satisfied on the balance of probability that such criticism is justified

CLAIM sentence:  Similar, but not identical, reasoning applies to my approach to the relations between the press and the police (Module Two) and the press and politicians (Module Three) and I will express my conclusions about the nature and impact of those relationships on the balance of probability

CLAIM sentence:  In both of these cases, there is no complication of pending criminal investigation which could limit my ability to focus on individual conduct

CLAIM sentence: org/linkedfiles/baha_mousa/key_documents/rulings/ standardofproofrulingmay

CLAIM sentence:  In connection both with the police and with politicians, the material before the Inquiry is sufficient to reach conclusions on the important questions without having to consider issues of reasonable suspicion but the complication in these relationships arises in connection with the additional question of perception

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, by way of example, it has been suggested that deals were struck between the press and politicians to the mutual advantage of both

CLAIM sentence:  That allegation has been strenuously denied both by the press and by politicians

CLAIM sentence:  Quite apart from that, however, there is the very different issue of whether, even assuming there was no such deal, the behaviour of both gave rise to legitimate perception in the public that the relationship was being conducted in a way that was not in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  On that basis, it may be entirely wrong to suggest or conclude that there was impropriety of any sort but still correct to decide that the way in which the relationship is handled from the perspective both of the press and politicians requires adjustment so that each can perform their duty but in a way that does not give rise an adverse perception

CLAIM sentence:   PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapTer  The reporT 

CLAIM sentence:  It was set up, and its Terms of Reference were finalised, with the support of the Devolved Governments of the UK in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales

CLAIM sentence:  In so far as my recommendations address matters within areas of devolved competence, it will of course be for the devolved administrations and legislatures to consider them in the usual way

CLAIM sentence:  I have not, however, sought to any extent at all in this Report to analyse the position separately from the perspective of the devolved jurisdictions, nor to acknowledge, where legal matters are considered, the points on which different law applies in different parts of the UK

CLAIM sentence:  My timetable did not allow for that; it would have been a very complex and time- consuming exercise

CLAIM sentence:  I recognise in the result that my Report may be less helpful to those with decision-making responsibilities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, but I have sought to set out my analysis and conclusions in a sufficiently explicit and reasoned way to enable the experts within the devolved jurisdictions to see as readily as possible how they could be made to fit

CLAIM sentence:  This Report fulfils three quite separate functions

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of the Inquiry was to inquire into the culture practices and ethics of the press and to make recommendations

CLAIM sentence:  By conducting the Inquiry in public and in such a way that it can be followed by anyone with an interest to do so, the story has emerged but it is important that it is collected together in one place and I have attempted to do that as a balanced account of what has transpired

CLAIM sentence:  Anyone is able to go onto the Inquiry website, watch the play-back of the evidence, read every statement of witnesses whether called or simply introduced into the record, examine every relevant document in the form made part of that record whether specifically referred to not and consider every submission from a Core Participant or Counsel to the Inquiry and so form his or her own conclusion about the balance of the Report

CLAIM sentence:  Collecting the material and presenting it in an ordered form has generated an additional issue

CLAIM sentence:  It will quickly be obvious that some stories appear in more than one place in the narrative and some not at all

CLAIM sentence:  That is not because different examples of types of conduct are not available from either the material called at the Inquiry or read into the record; neither is it because of my over-reliance on a particular witness and the story that he or she had to recount

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to appreciate, however, that in some instances, manifestations of different criticisms come together in the same story, aggravating the wrong committed

CLAIM sentence:  It is equally valuable, however, to understand the same story from the perspective of the victim, simply trying to deal with life events as they occur (with the press providing its own, sometimes monumental, challenges) or, in some cases, over a lengthy period of time, again  A\xc

CLAIM sentence:  and again having to confront different attacks from the same or different quarters

CLAIM sentence:  To tell every story was simply impractical but to say (as is frequently asserted) that the Inquiry has been hijacked by celebrities is both wrong and unfair; the claim may be thought to be an attempt to divert attention away from the real harm caused to real people

CLAIM sentence:  The second purpose of the Report is to set out my conclusions on the culture, practices and ethics of the press and the other areas of my Terms of Reference

CLAIM sentence:  It is also to identify and explain my recommendations as to the way forward: that, after all, is precisely what the Terms of Reference require me to do

CLAIM sentence:  Both conclusions and recommendations appear throughout the Report but are, I hope, reasoned and comprehensible

CLAIM sentence:  The third purpose of the Report is, in my view, the most important

CLAIM sentence:  It is to allow those who read it to reach their own conclusions about every aspect of the Terms of Reference

CLAIM sentence:  From the outset (and consistently the subject of commentary throughout the hearings and subsequently), it has been suggested that a judge is wholly unsuited to the task of seeking to discern, let alone determine, how a free press should operate and how it should exercise its rights of free speech

CLAIM sentence:  I have no doubt that all sections of the press will report and comment upon this Report, each newspaper or title from its own perspective

CLAIM sentence:  It will be for anyone who reads the Report to decide the extent to which any comment upon it is fair in the same way that it will be for the Government (maintaining, I hope, the cross party consensus with which this Inquiry was set up) to decide how far it wishes to take the recommendations that I have made

CLAIM sentence:  That is where the ultimate decision making properly lies

CLAIM sentence:  It is also necessary to say something about the timetable

CLAIM sentence:  The first was the extension, beyond that initially envisaged, of the Terms of Reference

CLAIM sentence:  More significant, however, was the appreciation that there was no body of evidence immediately available to provide the basis from which to commence the calling of witnesses; the police investigation was ongoing and therefore it was not appropriate to seek to use the evidence that had been collected during that inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, it was only possible to start the collection of evidence in August  and, given the holiday period, it was inevitable that it would take some time to be prepared; only after it had been prepared and served could it be assimilated and the hearings commenced

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, the oral hearings commenced on  November  and, had it been essential to deliver a Report by the end of July , they would have had to have been concluded by April

CLAIM sentence:  Given the remit involving the press, the public, the police and politicians, this was simply not feasible

CLAIM sentence:  I did so because I recognised the fundamental importance of early delivery of a Report so that decisions could be made and implemented as to the future within a reasonable timetable, rather than being pushed back thereby falling in the run up to a general election

CLAIM sentence:   PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Report 

CLAIM sentence:  Meeting the timetable has not been without consequences

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to the evidence, careful selection was made of those witnesses who would be called to give evidence on oath and representations were invited from Core Participants in relation to other potential witnesses whose statements, in the absence of objection, could be read into the record without their personal attendance

CLAIM sentence:  Understanding the approach of the Inquiry to the evidence generally, sensible decisions were made by the Core Participants whose assistance, throughout, has been of very great value

CLAIM sentence:  The consequence, as I have explained, is that a vast body of evidence was not in fact the subject of oral exposition and the timetable for the hearings was met

CLAIM sentence:  There are, however, no different classes of evidence: although some of the material provided in writing is not referred to, it has all been considered

CLAIM sentence:  As for the Report, the consequences are different

CLAIM sentence:  In an ideal world, I would have wished to write, re-write and hone this Report so that every nuance could be the subject of mature reflection

CLAIM sentence:  As previous inquiries have shown, given the amount of evidence whether oral, documentary or read-in, that would have been a task of very many months duration

CLAIM sentence:  I place on record my appreciation to all those who have collated the evidence in relation to different aspects of the Report

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, I repeat that every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation expressed in this Report is mine alone

CLAIM sentence:  Equally, any errors are my responsibility

CLAIM sentence:   That is to say, I have been assisted in the drafting by Counsel and by civil servant members of the Inquiry team; the Assessors have been invited to provide comments on drafts only where appropriate

CLAIM sentence:  This Part of the Report alludes to some of the fundamental principles which must provide the context for any consideration of the role of the press in the United Kingdom

CLAIM sentence:  It does so principally for the purpose of brief overview and explanation, and to set the scene for the narrative, analysis and recommendations which follow

CLAIM sentence:  The principles which are set out are not simply derived from philosophical or jurisprudential writings

CLAIM sentence:  Proprietors, editors and journalists wrote and spoke about the importance of what they do for all of us in the UK, and the value it has for our common life

CLAIM sentence:  Politicians described the principles informing their own relationship with the media, including as policy-makers

CLAIM sentence:  Commentators suggested the matters that the Inquiry should bear particularly in mind in approaching its task

CLAIM sentence:  This brief overview seeks to distil, without necessarily fully rehearsing, the essence of the points of principle which were put before the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Without seeking, or needing, to do full justice to the fine nuances of opinion which it is possible to hold and debate about such matters, this Part of the Report aims simply to set out a framework of understanding which is relatively uncontroversial

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore the intention simply to underline, to put beyond doubt, the extent to which the Inquiry has itself proceeded on the basis of the perspectives set out, and to do so in terms with which I believe that most of the public would be able broadly to agree

CLAIM sentence:  It is also the intention of this Part of the Report to clarify some of the strands of thought which have been woven through a great deal of the evidence the Inquiry has received

CLAIM sentence:  Concepts such as the freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the public interest have been much referred to in the course of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  These are potent expressions, and powerful and important concepts; commensurate clarity and care is needed in their deployment in the context of a Report on the culture, practices and ethics of the press

CLAIM sentence:  Attempting an all-embracing definition of concepts of this sort, even within the limitations of the Inquirys Terms of Reference, is neither necessary nor appropriate

CLAIM sentence:  Some measure of clarification is nevertheless attempted, both to underline the importance of these concepts and also to indicate the traps they can sometimes set for the unwary

CLAIM sentence:  This is not intended to make any claims to an especial authority in doing so, but only to give some indication of why they are important, and the limits of the uses and justifications to which they can be put

CLAIM sentence:  These are precious and fundamental principles, to which great respect must be paid; at the same time, they must be handled thoughtfully and with care

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry was considerably assisted in this respect not only by the way that the issue has been put by so many journalists but, in particular by the expert witness evidence it received, in both written and oral form

CLAIM sentence:  I recognise that I have freely borrowed from their observations in some of what follows and I am grateful to them

CLAIM sentence:  In doing so and while acknowledging this debt, I should make clear, that the analysis set out here is entirely that of the Inquiry and is not to be taken to be representative of the entirety of the views of the expert witnesses, collectively or individually

CLAIM sentence:  As with other aspects of the evidence that I have sought to summarise, I can only commend those interested to the original evidence: any summary cannot attempt to do full justice to it

CLAIM sentence:  Context A free press is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men prize; it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny Under dictatorship the press is bound to languish But where free institutions are indigenous to the soil and men have the habit of liberty, the press will continue to be the Fourth Estate, the vigilant guardian of the rights of the ordinary citizen

CLAIM sentence:  For this reason the courts here and elsewhere, have recognised the cardinal importance of press freedom and the need for any restriction on that freedom to be proportionate and no more than necessary to promote the legitimate object of the restriction

CLAIM sentence:  The quality of that freedom also requires consideration; again, as Lord Bingham indicates, freedom has many components and is rarely in a democracy absolute or paramount, if only because democracy may itself be thought of as a system for reconciling competing freedoms

CLAIM sentence:  Equally, a press that is free and nothing else will not necessarily enhance democracy

CLAIM sentence:  Other conditions are necessary too; Lord Binghams formulation that the press must also be active, professional and inquiring, and Churchills vision of the press as vigilant guardians of the rights of the ordinary citizen raise interesting questions about how freedoms can be used

CLAIM sentence:  My attention has been drawn by press Core Participants to statements of the highest judicial authority which develop these points in a variety of ways

CLAIM sentence:  In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms ()  A

CLAIM sentence:  But it is well recognised that it is also instrumentally important

CLAIM sentence:  First, it promotes the self-fulfilment of individuals in society

CLAIM sentence:  The free flow of information and ideas informs political debate

CLAIM sentence:  It is a safety valve: people are more ready to accept  Speech,   R (Laporte) v Chief Constable of Gloucestershire [] UKHL   \xcdecisions that go against them if they can in principle seek to influence them

CLAIM sentence:  It acts as a brake on the abuse of power by public officials

CLAIM sentence:  It facilitates the exposure of errors in the governance and administration of justice of the country: see Stone, Seidman, Sunstein and Tushnet, Constitutional Law, rd ed

CLAIM sentence:  It is this last interest which is engaged in the present case

CLAIM sentence:  They seek with the assistance of journalists, who have the resources to do the necessary investigations, to make public the wrongs which they allegedly suffered

CLAIM sentence:  At a pragmatic level, freedom to disseminate and receive information on political matters is essential to the system of parliamentary democracy cherished in this country

CLAIM sentence:  This freedom enables those who elect representatives to Parliament to make an informed choice, regarding individuals as well as policies, and those elected to make informed decisions

CLAIM sentence:  Without freedom of expression by the media, freedom of expression would be a hollow concept

CLAIM sentence:  The same point has been made with equal force in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg

CLAIM sentence:  The Strasbourg Court held that his conviction constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression under Article  of the ECHR

CLAIM sentence: the pre-eminent role of the press in a State governed by the rule of law must not be forgotten

CLAIM sentence:  Although it must not overstep various bounds set, inter alia, for the prevention of disorder and the protection of the reputation of others, it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest

CLAIM sentence:  Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, it gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of public opinion; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate which is at the very core of a democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  The fundamental importance of the freedom of the press was a very familiar theme of the evidence received by the Inquiry, and rightly so

CLAIM sentence:  The description of the importance of press freedom was put to the Inquiry largely in two forms: first, as a negative or default argument (any interference with any sort of freedom must always be justified in a liberal democracy) and, second, as a positive argument (the press must be free to fulfil its important role)

CLAIM sentence:  To the extent that either or both of these  Chapter  | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy B\xcarguments was deployed in the service of contentions about the right approach for the Inquiry to take to its Terms of Reference, and explicitly to the question of how far it might end by asking new things of the press in respect of its culture, practices and ethics, it is necessary to stand back and reflect on the origins and explanations for the importance of press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  a brief history of press freedom in the United 

CLAIM sentence:  Kingdom The history of the press is filled with struggles against the state and debates over the rights and privileges of the press

CLAIM sentence:  It thus provides an essential background to understanding the commitment of modern democratic society to freedom of the press

CLAIM sentence:  It also explains the strength of feeling demonstrated by so many journalist witnesses

CLAIM sentence:  From the advent of the printing press in  until the end of the seventeenth century, state licensing meant that the Government and the Church could control the press, and in particular prevent the printing of seditious or heretical works

CLAIM sentence:  This system of state control endured under a series of decrees issued and enforced by the Star Chamber

CLAIM sentence:  However, in  licensing was reintroduced by Cromwells Parliament in an effort to suppress the publication of material about Charles I

CLAIM sentence:  This act moved John Milton to write his now immortal defence of the free press in The Areopagitica, a Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing: The attempt to keep out evil doctrine by licensing is like the exploit of that gallant man who thought to keep out the crows by shutting his park gate Lords and Commons of England, consider what nation it is whereof ye are: a nation not slow and dull, but of a quick, ingenious and piercing spirit

CLAIM sentence:  It must not be shackled or restricted

CLAIM sentence:  Miltons plea went unheeded and for the next half century the press was governed under a licensing system which suppressed all but official publications

CLAIM sentence:  Licensing eventually ended in  when the House of Commons refused to renew the licensing legislation

CLAIM sentence:  Ever since the licensing of the press was abolished, there has existed a general right to publish newspapers, books or magazines without state authorisation

CLAIM sentence:  Although no longer required to obtain a licence for the mere act of publishing, there remained a number of restraints on the content of what the press could publish

CLAIM sentence:  The offences of criminal and seditious libel, for example, were still punishable at common law

CLAIM sentence:  These taxes on knowledge, intended to curb the radical press, created a culture in which journalists and newspapers subsisted through bribes and government subsidies

CLAIM sentence:  It took a century of campaigning by proponents of the radical press and free speech to secure further independence for the newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  Parliament ended the ban on press reporting in Parliament in , after a legal battle by the radical MP and journalist John Wilkes against attempts to arrest several printers for reporting parliamentary debates

CLAIM sentence:  The Libel Acts of  PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB\xc and , restoring the right to trial by jury and introducing a truth defence to the charge of seditious libel, provided the press with a measure of security against unmeritorious criminal prosecutions

CLAIM sentence:  However, by the early part of the twentieth century, a new form of limitation on press independence had emerged

CLAIM sentence:  For much of the inter-war period the proprietors of these large corporations the press barons of the day dominated the press

CLAIM sentence:  During the Second World War, Government censorship returned, this time in the guise of the now infamous Defence of the Realm Regulations

CLAIM sentence:  Regulation D conferred on the Home Secretary the personal power to ban any publication which published material calculated to foment opposition to the war

CLAIM sentence:  Following mass rallies in response, the ban was lifted

CLAIM sentence:  In general, however, the press response to the unprecedented levels of Government censorship which characterised the war period was muted

CLAIM sentence:  Any fair-minded person with journalistic experience will admit that during this war official censorship has not been particularly irksome

CLAIM sentence:  We have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian co-ordination that it might have been reasonable to expect

CLAIM sentence:  The press has some justified grievances, but on the whole the Government has behaved well and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions

CLAIM sentence:  The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary

CLAIM sentence:  During the immediate post-war period, the growth in the power of a limited number of press organisations increased

CLAIM sentence:  Growing concern over the dominance of a small group of proprietors led to the establishment of the first Royal Commission on the Press: with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recommendations thereon

CLAIM sentence:  The solution proposed by the Commission was the creation of a General Council of the Press: to safeguard the freedom of the press; to encourage the growth of a sense of public responsibility and public service amongst all engaged in the profession of journalism []; and to further the efficiency of the profession and the well being of those who practise it

CLAIM sentence:   The Freedom of the Press-proposed preface to Animal Farm, publication of which was delayed until the end of the war to avoid causing offence to the Soviet Union  Great Britain, Royal Commission of the Press, -: Report, p  para , Ibid  Chapter  | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy B\xc

CLAIM sentence:  Concerns about the continued diminution in press diversity led to the establishment in  of the second Royal Commission on the Press: to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom, including (a) manufacturing, printing, distribution and other costs, (b) efficiency of production, and (c) advertising and other revenue, including any revenue derived from interests in television; to consider whether these factors tend to diminish diversity of ownership and control or the number or variety of such publications, having regard to the importance, in the public interest, of the accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion

CLAIM sentence:  It found that the share of circulation controlled by the large proprietors had substantially increased; the leading three proprietors share of the national daily press amounted to almost %

CLAIM sentence:  It severely condemned the General Council and urged reform

CLAIM sentence:  The industry eventually responded in , when the Press Council was created to replace the General Council

CLAIM sentence:  Notwithstanding this reform, there remained major concerns about the need to protect editors and journalists from the control of proprietors

CLAIM sentence:  The third Royal Commission on the Press was established in : To inquire into the factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity and editorial standards of newspapers and periodicals and the public freedom of choice of newspapers and periodicals, nationally, regionally and locally

CLAIM sentence:  The report recommended the development of a written Code of Practice, warning it is unhappily certain that the Council has so far failed to persuade the knowledgeable public that it deals satisfactorily with complaints against newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  The  Calcutt Report recommended the establishment of a new Press Complaints Commission to replace the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC was established in  and tasked with administering a new Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Since its inception, concerns have been voiced about the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  These developments (and, indeed, a fuller history of all these reviews) are described later in the report

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst attempts to achieve a functioning of system of self-regulation stalled, great strides were achieved in securing legal protection for a free press

CLAIM sentence:  Beginning in , when freedom of expression was enshrined in Article  of the European Convention of Human Rights (the ECHR), legal protections for the press have steadily increased

CLAIM sentence:  Although Article  is a protection for individual rather than corporate freedom of expression, and does not expressly refer to the press, press reportage has consistently been recognised in case law as protected speech

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard, the European Court of Human Rights has emphasised the pre-eminent role of the press in a democracy and its duty to act as a public watch-dog

CLAIM sentence:  It has also recognised the importance of pluralism in the media, noting that there can be no democracy without pluralism

CLAIM sentence:    Great Britain, Royal Commission on the Press: -: Report (Cmnd )  http://hansard

CLAIM sentence:  Consistently with other international instruments protecting freedom of expression, Article  expressly acknowledges that freedom of expression generally, including freedom of press expression, may be restricted where necessary to protect the legitimate aims of a democracy

CLAIM sentence:  The court has recognised that freedom of expression may need to be restricted in the interests of national security and public morality, as well as individual rights to privacy and peaceful enjoyment of property

CLAIM sentence:  The ECHR jurisprudence has nonetheless afforded a broad degree of protection of the press, drawing a distinction, however, between the protection afforded to reporting contributing to debate on economic, social and political issues and press reports involving tawdry allegations about an individuals private life

CLAIM sentence:  Since , Article  has been incorporated into domestic law through the mechanisms set out in the Human Rights Act (HRA) 

CLAIM sentence:  In the years since incorporation, the domestic courts have joined Strasbourg in seeking to strike a balance between the protection afforded a free press, the restrictions necessarily placed on that freedom in a democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  This brief history makes a number of points about the values and functions of press freedom in democracy

CLAIM sentence:  First, the struggle to achieve press freedom (in the sense of freedom from the power of the State) was driven by the democratic value served by the press

CLAIM sentence:  Freedom of the press, according to this historical tradition, was and is celebrated not simply because of any intrinsic value of a free press, but because of the public benefits associated with free flow of information and debate

CLAIM sentence:  Second, it is clear from this history that threats to the democratic function of a free press can take many forms

CLAIM sentence:  Government licensing and censorship of content is the most easily identifiable restriction and was deployed with invidious effect in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries

CLAIM sentence:  The democratic freedom to own and operate a printing press in the first place is precious and hard won

CLAIM sentence:  However, as the more recent history of the struggle for press freedom illustrates, there are other sources of power which may threaten press freedom, and indeed other freedoms which may have a legitimate claim to being taken into account

CLAIM sentence:  It also contains within itself the reverse potential, that is to say, to create undemocratic concentrations of power and undermine freedoms and the public good

CLAIM sentence:  The challenge of securing the democratic benefits of a free press, whilst obviating the harm presented by the unchecked exercise of concentrated or unaccountable power, is the legacy of the historic struggle to free the press

CLAIM sentence:  Professor Baroness Onora ONeill put the matter in this way: I think if we just say were in favour of press freedom, we beg all the important questions

CLAIM sentence:  The important question is: which conception of press freedom and how do you justify it? 

CLAIM sentence: \t The\timportance\tof\ta\tfree\tpress:\tfree\tcommunication 

CLAIM sentence:  When confronting the challenge of securing a free press it is important to be clear about why we value a free press and what we seek to protect

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps the most enduring and least contentious rationale for a free press is the argument that a free press contributes to the  Application / Armonien v Lithuania ( November ), para   p, para -, Professor Baroness Onora ONeill, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This can be put in a very broad way, for example: the public interest in a free press is best construed as an interest in adequate (or better than adequate) standards of public communication, that allow readers, listeners and viewers to gain information and form judgements, and so as to participate in social, cultural and democratic life

CLAIM sentence:  A free press is a public good because it is needed for civic and common life

CLAIM sentence:  Its useful partly for the results it creates but its also a good in itself that we all have the status of being able to take part in the liberal public sphere and it seems the press plays a role in that

CLAIM sentence:  People who are insufficiently articulate or insufficiently confident to take part in the public speech, the press can give them a voice

CLAIM sentence:  Representative of such viewpoints was the reference by Alan Rusbridger to: the simple craft of reporting: recording things; asking questions; being an observer; giving context

CLAIM sentence:  Its reporting the rival arguments over climate change and helping the public to evaluate where the truth lies

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to note that this is not just a general argument for the benefits of free self- expression

CLAIM sentence:  This argument has no direct relevance to press freedom because, put simply, press organisations are not human beings with a personal need to be able to self-express

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, an argument for free speech for the powerless will not make a case for free speech for a powerful organisation

CLAIM sentence:  The general argument for a free press as a means of free communication, on the contrary, has to do with a number of different things

CLAIM sentence:  These include the ability to give a powerful voice in the public domain to those unable to do so effectively for themselves (perhaps of diminishing importance in the era of social media and self-expression on the internet)

CLAIM sentence:  Importantly, it is also to do with the constitution by the media in their own right of a public forum, where information, ideas and entertainment are both circulated and held up to scrutiny

CLAIM sentence:  The essence  p para d), Professor Baroness Onora ONeill, http://levesoninquiry

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB\xcof the importance of a free press is therefore not an interest in free self expression but in free communication, the free flow of knowledge, information and ideas: Readers, listeners and viewers dont need media that express themselves: they need media that meet at least minimal standards for adequate communication with intended audiences

CLAIM sentence:  The critical public interest in a free press is not so much in a press which exercises self-expression as in a press that is free from censorship, not subject to some kind of central control

CLAIM sentence:  Even if the press does have a very important right to freedom of expression, you have to remember that its justified by what it does for individuals by constituting a public sphere in which all individuals can take part

CLAIM sentence:  A free press will not necessarily provide an effective market-place for ideas

CLAIM sentence:  The freedom of the press is a prerequisite for that, but not sufficient in itself, for all sorts of reasons

CLAIM sentence:  There must be some degree of effective connection between communicators in the press; and when some elements of the press are more powerful communicators than other papers and individuals, its capacity to facilitate informed debate may be impaired

CLAIM sentence:  In a similar vein, a measure of plurality of voices is required if a free press is to enhance democratic debate

CLAIM sentence:  The argument from truth, which identifies free speech as an important condition for the attainment of truth, is also not straightforward when applied to the press

CLAIM sentence:  Mills argument that society will benefit from the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error may hold in relation to the battle between truth and falsity expressed by individuals (but even then, only in the sort of discourse which aims at the truth)

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is less certain that truth will prevail in the encounter between individual and institutional speech, or between different forms of institutional speech

CLAIM sentence:  To put the matter bluntly, there is nothing to stop a free press from freely deciding to support corruption or to be involved in it

CLAIM sentence:  We cannot assume that a free press, or specific agents within a free press, will be motivated to provide the kind of content that is, in fact, in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The fundamental point is that unlike freedom of expression for individuals, which has intrinsic merit as a form of self-expression, press freedom has value to some extent as an aspect of commercial freedom, and to some extent because of the functions it serves

CLAIM sentence:  In other words, freedom of the press is largely understood as an instrumental good, to be valued, promoted and protected to the extent that it is with the result that it is thereby enabled to flourish commercially as a sector and to serve its important democratic functions

CLAIM sentence:  The importance of a free press: public debate and holding power to account There are two, more specific, strands to explanation for the importance of a free press in a democracy

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy B\xca free press serves the public interest instrumentally in two key respects: Constraining power: A free press is an important check on political and other forms of social power (corporate, individual)

CLAIM sentence:  To achieve this end, the press requires not just freedom from interference with the form and content of what it says, but also the capacity to investigate and acquire information

CLAIM sentence:  A free press especially a diverse press in which many views are represented is an important forum for public deliberation and education, a means for enabling the public to engage in informed democratic decision-making

CLAIM sentence:   there are also some very well-known instrumental benefits of the press

CLAIM sentence:  So its a very important check on political power and other forms of power

CLAIM sentence:   The public interest in a free press lies largely in the character of our society as a liberal democracy

CLAIM sentence:  It is in the public interest that there be a free press because and insofar as such a press serves as a necessary bulwark against government duplicity or tyranny

CLAIM sentence:  A free press serves also to inform people about the principles under which they live and the policies which government adopts and pursues in their name

CLAIM sentence:  This is of particular importance in a democratic society where governments are elected by the people and act in the name of the people

CLAIM sentence:  Insofar as it reminds us of the most important purpose of a free press, it also, and at the same time, reminds us of the most significant duties of a free press duties to communicate those things which people need to know if they are to be effective and informed citizens  The serious purpose the press serves, the purpose which makes it critical to a genuinely free and democratic society has two principal components to inform citizens and to enable citizens to hold accountable those who should be serving the wider public

CLAIM sentence:   A free press can communicate important facts that the public have a legitimate interest in knowing (and which others might want to conceal)

CLAIM sentence:  one aspect of the public interest in a free press is that it provides an essential set of checks and balances on power (and, more importantly, the abuse of power)

CLAIM sentence:  there is a public interest in learning of dangers and risks, even where others may wish to conceal them

CLAIM sentence:  A free press, free of the censorship and restrictions imposed by the powerful, serves the public interest by its investigative and communicative role

CLAIM sentence:  First, therefore, a free press serves democracy by enabling public deliberation

CLAIM sentence:  Citizens need information to make intelligent political choices

CLAIM sentence:  To this end, the press serves both as a conduit for the dissemination of information as well as a forum for public debate

CLAIM sentence:  The second way in which a free press serves the interests of democracy is through its public watchdog role, acting as a check on political and other holders of power

CLAIM sentence:  The press is able to perform this function because of its hard-won position as a powerful institution independent of the state, a position which earned it the nickname or sobriquet of the Fourth Estate amongst nineteenth century writers

CLAIM sentence:  The British press has a strong tradition of holding power to account

CLAIM sentence:  A forerunner of investigative journalism, Charles Dickens, exposed some of the cruellest aspects of Victorian society in his excoriating accounts of the work houses

CLAIM sentence:  Again, it is not a given that a press which is simply free will perform this function

CLAIM sentence:  The press must be independent from those in power and must be afforded the privileges necessary to enable investigative journalism to take place

CLAIM sentence:  It must also be active, professional and inquiring

CLAIM sentence:  However, this power must also be used consistently with other democratic values

CLAIM sentence:  A free press in a democracy must therefore operate within certain parameters

CLAIM sentence:  Chief amongst these is the requirement that press freedom promotes, and operates within, the rule of law which itself is often described as the cornerstone of a democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  Although the democratic function of the rule of law is primarily associated with the idea of government in accordance with the law, the doctrines deeper implications concern the need for accountability and constraint of all power in a modern democracy: Be you never so high, the law is above you  

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Bingham encapsulated this essential function of the rule of law in his now celebrated monograph on the subject, in which he defined the rule of law as follows: [A]ll persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private, should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly and prospectively promulgated and publicly administered in the courts

CLAIM sentence:  In other words, the rule of law is at the cornerstone of democracy because it protects the freedoms on which democracy depends, including press freedom, from arbitrary power

CLAIM sentence:  In a modern democracy that abides by the rule of law, press freedom can never mean a press which sits outside, above and beyond, or in disregard of, the law

CLAIM sentence:  That general principle relates to the law (both common law and statute) which applies to press organisations in the same way as it applies to other commercial organisations; these include the laws of taxation, for example, and, where relevant, the requirements of company or trust law

CLAIM sentence:  It also applies to the law which is of particular application to the activities of the press, specifically including information-gathering and publication

CLAIM sentence:  Appendix  to the Report sets out the principal sources of law applying in this more activity-specific way to press organisations

CLAIM sentence:  Some of this law is of particular, or modified, application to the press; whether or not that is the case, in many ways it does constrain the conduct (or freedom) of the press in order to hold it in balance with other important aspects of the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  How it does so is considered more fully below

CLAIM sentence:  The point of paramount importance for present purposes, however, is that there is a fundamental public interest in respect by the press for and obedience to the law

CLAIM sentence:  A press considering itself to be above the law would be a profoundly anti-democratic press, arrogating to itself powers and immunities from accountability which would be incompatible with a free society more generally

CLAIM sentence:  All who have the privileges and responsibilities of holding power to account, including police, politicians and press, must themselves champion and uphold the accountabilities they proclaim for others

CLAIM sentence:  The rule of law, in other words, guards the guardians and is a guarantor of the freedom of the press, not an exception to it

CLAIM sentence:  Reference has already been made to the separate public interest in a press which is diverse

CLAIM sentence:  To the extent that the press does more, and is capable of influencing public opinion, the argument becomes even stronger

CLAIM sentence:  The simple point I am making about the press is that an irreverent and opinionated print media should, taken as a whole, reflect a range of views if it is fully to realise its potential to contribute to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  From this brief overview, it is possible to see that the organisation, activities and products of the press are in many ways limited by, or made accountable through, the operation of the law, that is to say, both common law and statute

CLAIM sentence:  In this, the press is no different from any other provider of, or participant in, democratic public life

CLAIM sentence:  And where it limits the activities or the press, or makes the press formally accountable for its actions, the law is simply performing its inherent democratic functions of balancing competing freedoms and competing public goods

CLAIM sentence:  The first of these is the proposition that the press is, or should be, entitled to break the law where to do so would be in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  It is certainly true that there are a number of modifications in various aspects of the law applicable to the press which gives it greater latitude within the law than is afforded to others

CLAIM sentence:  But that, emphatically, does not mean recognition within the law that, as a matter of general principle, the press possesses any entitlement or expectation to be indulged, in the national interest, in special exemption from  PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB\xcobserving the requirements of the law

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has been asked to consider the possibility of recommending that a general public interest defence be accorded to journalists in relation to what might be described as the whole of the criminal law insofar as it relates to the press

CLAIM sentence:  The other reason to clarify that a free press within a mature democracy operates within the rule of law is to address the line of argument, put to the Inquiry from time to time, that a statutory framework for, or underpinning of, press standards would by itself be repugnant to a proper view of the freedom of the press

CLAIM sentence:  This argument, in turn, appeared in two distinct forms

CLAIM sentence:  The first version of this argument posits that any change to the law by Act of Parliament to require or restrict any behaviour by the press, or to increase its accountabilities, regardless of the content or justification of any such change, is intolerable in a democracy as an act of state control

CLAIM sentence:  I understand this argument, but believe that it completely lacks merit

CLAIM sentence:  It seems to rely, at some level, on a mistaken conflation of state censorship with the ordinary democratic processes of making and applying statute law

CLAIM sentence:  As has been illustrated, there are many forms of statute law which already restrict the activities of the press, whether in terms of their organisation, competition or activities up to and including in limited cases what it may or may not be lawful to publish (race hate, for example)

CLAIM sentence:  On the face of it, these statutory restrictions are legitimate and proportionate exercises in democratic lawmaking, balancing competing public freedoms and goods

CLAIM sentence:  Of course, as such, they need to be justified, and considered on their merits

CLAIM sentence:  Not every statutory restriction possible will be proportionate and justifiable

CLAIM sentence:  But to contend that no statutory reform could be so is to push the argument far beyond any reasonable statement of principle

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately, there is no necessary connection between statutory underpinning of a regulatory system (to apply the argument more closely to home), on the one hand, and state censorship on the other, nor in my view is there some sort of slippery slope gliding from the first to the second

CLAIM sentence:  The second variant of the argument is more limited

CLAIM sentence:  It is put by witnesses, such as Lord Hunt, on the basis that any proposal for statutory reform of the law as it applies to the press contains within it a risk of exposure to a Parliamentary process in which a commitment to the importance of press freedom does not at present exist

CLAIM sentence:  The first is that I am aware of no empirical evidence to support it

CLAIM sentence:  On the contrary, in recent years there are, I think, examples only of Parliamentary law making in respect of the press which is clearly focused on strengthening, rather than restricting, the freedoms of the press

CLAIM sentence:  The second objection is an objection of principle and constitution

CLAIM sentence:  More than one view is no doubt possible of how the freedoms of the press should best be held in balance with other freedoms and public goods

CLAIM sentence:  Parliament is the proper and legitimate forum within which such views can and must be debated in a democracy

CLAIM sentence:  If the press fears for its liberties in a Parliamentary context, its answer is to ensure that the case is put with maximum clarity in that forum, not to seek to avoid the forum altogether

CLAIM sentence: \t The\tprotection\tof\tsources\tand\tother\tlegal\tprivileges\tof\t 

CLAIM sentence:  the press A free press is able to perform valuable functions which individual free speech cannot

CLAIM sentence:  It is because of the position of the press as an institution of power that it is able to stand up to and speak truth to power

CLAIM sentence:  The professional skills and resources at its disposal enable the press as an institution to carry out ground-breaking investigations in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  It is these considerations and functions which have resulted in the press as an institution being afforded certain privileges going beyond those protected by freedom of speech

CLAIM sentence:  Principal amongst these is the press privilege not to disclose sources of information

CLAIM sentence:  Now enshrined in section  of the Contempt of Court Act , the privilege means that a publisher cannot be compelled to reveal the source of published information unless a court considers such disclosure to be in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of crime

CLAIM sentence:  The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE)  confers a similar procedural privilege, preventing the police from access to journalistic material without authorisation obtained by application to the court

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, the courts have also recognised the right not to disclose sources as an important facet of the free press, as is reflected in the following words of Lord Woolf CJ: The fact that journalists sources can be reasonably confident that their identity will not be disclosed makes a significant contribution to the ability of the press to perform their role in society of making information available to the public

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, whilst the press are not above the law, the criminal law does on occasion accord journalists a form of protected status as well as certain protections in relation to otherwise defamatory publications (e

CLAIM sentence:  qualified privilege and the Reynolds defence)

CLAIM sentence:  These matters are all covered in some detail later in the report and stand to be enhanced in the Defamation Bill presently before Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  Suffice to say, these privileges afforded to the press are important precisely because they enable the press to serve the public interest in carrying out investigative journalism and disseminating information: they are not afforded for any other reason

CLAIM sentence:   Ashworth Hospital Authority v MGN Ltd []  All ER , 

CLAIM sentence:  But it cannot be viewed in isolation

CLAIM sentence:  As has been demonstrated, it is, itself, an aspect of wider public interests such as the public interest in democracy, for example, in public life and in the rule of law

CLAIM sentence:  There are other public interests also of which press freedom is not a major aspect, and with which it may sometimes be in tension

CLAIM sentence:  This section considers some of them, in order to put the public interest in a free press in its fuller context, and to reflect on how competing aspects of the public interest are resolved and reconciled

CLAIM sentence:  The public interest is therefore not a monolithic concept

CLAIM sentence:  Nor is it the particular property of the press or any other organisation or sector

CLAIM sentence:  In a democracy, this is principally a role for Government that is, for example, used to grappling with a balance between the public interests in public spending and in low taxes, in liberty and in security, in high accountability and low bureaucracy

CLAIM sentence:  That is by no means to portray any aspects of the public interest as mutually exclusive or zero- sum

CLAIM sentence:  On the contrary, the fact that many aspects of public, and indeed private, life may benefit the public makes the task of the decision-maker a much more subtle and skilful one than that

CLAIM sentence:  A wider perspective than that of the press is therefore inevitable: There are more components of the public interest than those that are served by a free press, so that the press may need to control its activity to respect those wider factors

CLAIM sentence:  Sometimes it seems that the presss confidence that its activities are serving the public interest makes it insensitive to the complexity of that notion

CLAIM sentence:  Most proponents of free speech, for example, accept that its exercise must be restricted in order to protect the rights and interests of others

CLAIM sentence:  There is an important public interest in free speech, and there is also an important public interest in the civil liberties of individuals

CLAIM sentence:  Certain acts of speech, such as speech inciting violence or race hate, are so connected with producing specific conduct as to be relatively unprotected

CLAIM sentence:  Even Milton, in a passage from the Areopagitica overshadowed by his rhetoric in defence of a free press, acknowledged necessary limits to free speech (although not necessarily limits which we would now condone): I mean not tolerated popery, and open superstition, which as it extirpates all religious and civil supremacies, so itself should be extirpate that also which is impious or evil absolutely against faith or manners that no law can possibly permit that intends not to unlaw itself

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Professor- Christopher-Megone

CLAIM sentence:  Some of those who place the strongest emphasis on press freedom take their lead from the principally American brand of free speech absolutism

CLAIM sentence:  Free speech absolutists take the injunction of the First Amendment to the United States Constitutions at face value: that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech

CLAIM sentence:  Within this tradition, the United States Supreme Court has developed some of the most extensive protections of free speech in the democratic world, including the protection of religious and racist hate speech as a species of political speech

CLAIM sentence:  However, even in a culture committed to maximum protection to free speech, the absolutist position has proved impossible to sustain

CLAIM sentence:  In practice, the United States Supreme Court imposes extensive restrictions on freedom of speech by identifying categories of speech which are deemed not to fall within the scope of the First Amendment

CLAIM sentence:  These categories include for example advocacy of imminent illegal conduct, official secrets, defamation and fraudulent misrepresentation

CLAIM sentence:  The Supreme Court has also denied that certain categories of sexually explicit material amount to protected speech and has been prepared to sanction far more extensive restrictions of obscene material than exist in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  Article () of the ECHR itself permits formalities, conditions or restrictions on freedom of expression so long as they are prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, to the extent that press freedom is protected as an aspect of the protection of freedom of expression under Article , certain restrictions will be necessary and justifiable in the overall public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry invited thoughts on the place of press freedom within a wider concept of the public interest by asking the following question, both of some of the expert witnesses and more generally of the public at large via the Inquiry website: In order to maximise the overall public interest, with what other aspects of the public interest would freedom of expression, or freedom of the press, have to be balanced or limited? The Inquiry is particularly interested in the following, but there may be others: a

CLAIM sentence:  the interest of the public as a whole in good political governance, for example in areas such as: national security, public order and economic wellbeing, the rule of law, the proper independence and accountability of law enforcement agencies, and access to justice, and the democratic accountability of government for the formation and implementation of policy; b

CLAIM sentence:  the public interest in individual self-determination and the protection and enforcement of private interests, for example privacy, including (but not necessarily limited to) the rights to privacy specified in general in Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights and in European and national legislation on the protection of personal data, confidentiality, the protection of reputation, and intellectual and other property rights, and  Barendt, E, Freedom of Speech (nd ed), pp -  pp-, ibid  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB\xc individual freedom of expression and rights to receive and impart information where those interests and rights are not identical to the interests and rights of the press

CLAIM sentence:  What follows picks up some of the strands of thought in the responses the Inquiry received to these questions, and which seemed to be particularly pertinent

CLAIM sentence:  As noted above, the rights of individuals to freedom of expression have different origins from the public interest in the free speech of the press

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, freedom of expression or speech has value for individuals because of its ability to contribute to individual self-expression and self-realisation

CLAIM sentence:  Freedom of individual expression is important for the development and maintenance of social identity, and for forming relationships and associations, for developing projects (that may be counter to prevailing opinion or orthodoxy)

CLAIM sentence:  It was put to the Inquiry in this way: Freedom of thought and expression are also in the public interest because they constitute the public as a society of equals who respect one another: a society in which each member can participate and bring their own views to the public sphere

CLAIM sentence:  The public interest in individual freedom of expression is a distinct and different aspect of the public interest to press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  Here is one way in which the difference was explained: The press has, as it were, no self to fulfil, so an argument from self-fulfilment or self-development will not be directly relevant to questions of press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  More importantly, however, demands for press freedom are not (or not centrally) demands for free expression, but rather for the communication of information, and even if we think that individuals need to be able to express their views in order to develop fully as human beings, it does not follow that extensive freedom should be extended to those (eg the press) whose primary concern is with communication of information

CLAIM sentence:  To put the point starkly, those who aim to communicate must aspire to standards which are inapplicable for those who aim only to express their own views

CLAIM sentence:  The democratic rationale for freedom of expression in relation to individuals is also different from the democratic interest in a free press

CLAIM sentence:  It encompasses the individuals right to receive information, impart his or her own views and participate in democracy on an informed basis

CLAIM sentence:  Democracy benefits from a free press where the press, taken as a whole (a sum of partisan parts), communicate a plurality of views and provide a platform for public debate

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Professor-Susan-Mendus

CLAIM sentence:  In this context, mass communication by the press has the capacity both to enhance and inhibit individual freedom of expression

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore necessary to bear in mind the important point made to the Inquiry that some limitations to freedom of expression under the law are necessary in order to protect free speech from being inhibited by the free speech of others

CLAIM sentence:  This is a significant issue when there is an imbalance of power between the competing voices

CLAIM sentence:  As the New Zealand Law Commission pointed out in its submission to the Inquiry: [C]ensorship is not the only enemy of free speech

CLAIM sentence:  Those who exercise their free speech to intimidate, bully, denigrate and harass others on the internet lessen the credibility of free speech arguments

CLAIM sentence:  Even though the web provides those who are harmed by free speech the opportunity to exercise their right of reply, not all have the courage or the standing to exercise it

CLAIM sentence:  Such restrictions may be necessary to protect the freedom of expression of one individual or group of individuals from the speech of another individual or group of individuals

CLAIM sentence:  For example, speech which inhibits personal self-expression, be it artistic, religious or sexual, or which intimidates others into silence, inhibits freedom of expression of others

CLAIM sentence:  This is why society does not protect racial or religious hate speech in law

CLAIM sentence:  Nor is there protection in law for speech which is threatening, intimidating or harassing

CLAIM sentence:  It may also be necessary to balance the public interest in the free speech of the press against the public interest in the freedom of expression of individuals

CLAIM sentence:  This is, of course, a straightforward example

CLAIM sentence:  Political philosophers and ethicists would say that more complex issues arise where individual freedom of expression is put under pressure by the free speech of others in ways which are not objectionable in law but which nonetheless might be objectionable on other grounds

CLAIM sentence:  That is the context, for instance, in which debates about the portrayal of women and some minorities in the press is conducted

CLAIM sentence:  There is a public interest in the free expression of views (and images) which some, perhaps many, find objectionable

CLAIM sentence:  There is also a public interest in the liberty of individuals to live free from publicly promulgated stereotyping which limits their own expression and development of themselves

CLAIM sentence:  This is not in any sense a point about censorship or law

CLAIM sentence: \t Personal\tautonomy\tand\tcivil\tliberties 

CLAIM sentence:  To this extent, the public interest in individual freedom of expression is an aspect of a broader public interest in the autonomy, integrity and dignity of individuals

CLAIM sentence:  More generally, personal autonomy and human dignity require that individuals enjoy a protected personal sphere over which they exercise a measure of autonomous control

CLAIM sentence:  This is a dimension to the public interest which has a very ancient history in the UK and a special place in public imagination

CLAIM sentence:  It underlies the iconic status of habeas corpus as an early guarantee of personal liberty, and it underlies the special importance of freedom from interference in home life: an Englishmans home is his castle

CLAIM sentence:  Personal autonomy means that individuals must have a sphere in which they can exercise individual choices without interference from others (including the state)

CLAIM sentence:  This important personal sphere has been described in Western liberal philosophy in terms of the public interest in personal privacy

CLAIM sentence:  As David Feldman has stated: The combination of the idea of a right to be respected as a moral agent with the idea of social spheres of decision-making within which people or groups are entitled to regard themselves as free from outside coercion are, I suggest, of the essence off the notion of privacy as a civil liberty

CLAIM sentence:  It is evident and well evidenced that the public interest in free speech and free self- expression does, on occasion, come into tension with the public interest in individual privacy and autonomy

CLAIM sentence:  Article  of the ECHR (freedom of expression) is held in a dynamic balance with Article  (home and private life)

CLAIM sentence:  This dynamic balance has been developed in the English law of the protection of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  It is the space in which individuals are able to experiment with preferences and build personal relationships beyond public scrutiny and judgment

CLAIM sentence:  Violations of the private sphere prevent individuals from obtaining these benefits

CLAIM sentence:  The private sphere is also critical to personal autonomy as a space over which an individual exercises control

CLAIM sentence:  To invade someones privacy disregards that individuals choices as to when and by whom he or she will be seen and what personal information he or she will divulge

CLAIM sentence:  That element of choice and control of the personal sphere, although a fundamental public good, is also capable of being exercised contrary to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  So, for example, where an individual seeks to draw a veil of privacy over his or her criminal conduct, then the public interest in privacy will come into conflict with the public interest in law enforcement

CLAIM sentence:  But even there, the balanced result will be a partial and not a complete invasion of privacy, and one which is carefully prescribed by law; even in prison there are basic guarantees of human dignity

CLAIM sentence:  Where the public interest in free expression, in holding power to account, and in the pursuit of wrongdoing are all aligned on the one hand, and conflict with the public interest in an individuals privacy on the other, it is clear that the balance will be able to come down in  Feldman,D Secrecy, Dignity or Autonomy?

CLAIM sentence: oxfordjournals

CLAIM sentence: org/  Chapter  | Competing Public Interests B\xcfavour of the former

CLAIM sentence:  But again, it is important to keep in mind that the public interest in privacy, although compromised, never completely goes away

CLAIM sentence:  Where an individual has chosen to put a matter within the private sphere into the public domain, then he or she will have ceded a measure of control over it

CLAIM sentence:  Making choices of that nature is of the essence of personal autonomy

CLAIM sentence:  They do not necessarily imply that other choices will be made, much less that the freedom to make other choices is also being ceded

CLAIM sentence:  Everyone is entitled to some private space and always provided that there is no countervailing public interest in exposure of that private space (because, for example, it exposes crime or serious impropriety) there is a public interest in preserving it

CLAIM sentence:  This important point was made in a number of ways to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  An actor who is successful may be well known because his films are viewed by many

CLAIM sentence:  He may indeed wish and hope that many continue to view the results of his (and others) craft

CLAIM sentence:  It does not follow from this that he has a pathological compulsion to display himself, or to have every aspect of his life observed and documented

CLAIM sentence:  Nor does it follow that he has made some kind of tacit contractual agreement, where he has waived his privacy rights in exchange for fame

CLAIM sentence:  Those who do wish to enter a quasi-contractual agreement where they exchange the protection of privacy for an increase in their fame should not be prohibited from doing so, but it does not follow from this that everyone that the public might have an interest in should have their private lives placed at risk of intrusive and invasive acts

CLAIM sentence:  To treat an individual merely as something to be talked about, reported or looked at against his or her wishes is contrary to the public interest in individual autonomy, and to the ethical imperative to treat individuals as an end and not simply as a means

CLAIM sentence:  It is right to acknowledge however that the nature of the public interest in privacy and our understanding of the implications of choices made by individuals about their privacy are matters which lie at the heart of a number of fast-moving contemporary social changes, about which a clear and stable consensus may not yet have been reached

CLAIM sentence:  The explosion in use of social media, particularly by the young, has not yet been matched by a settled understanding of the implications of the choices that people make in placing private material online; many do so unwisely or naively with disproportionate exposure to exploitation of such material and the compromising of their privacy

CLAIM sentence:  At the same time, the nature of commercial celebrity culture continues to be pondered even as it evolves with great rapidity; again, there is as yet no settled understanding or consensus about this

CLAIM sentence:  A celebrity obviously gives up his or her right to privacy if he or she sells an intimate  See, however, the observations of Dr Manson on the nature of privacy rights in public spaces and the difference between degrees of intensity in the public gaze: pp-, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The right is clearly ceded as regards the transaction in question, but does that give the newspaper or even the press in general, a blank cheque for all purposes or for all time? Put in those terms, the answer, in my view, is clearly not

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, while the precise limits of the public interest in this area may be being developed and contested, the underlying basics must not be lost sight of

CLAIM sentence:  As Professor Megone put it: Journalists and editors need to recognise that both personal privacy and the importance of confidentiality can in part be understood in terms of an agents ownership of his own information, and the importance of that to the control of his own life

CLAIM sentence:  These are matters a free society seeks to protect as part of the public interest and the press need to be clear that they may well need respecting even when such respect adversely affects journalistic activity 

CLAIM sentence:  The protection of the reputation and rights of others is expressly identified by Article () of the ECHR as a necessary public interest basis for limiting the expression of others

CLAIM sentence:  The right to freedom of expression must therefore be accommodated with other fundamental liberties

CLAIM sentence:  The relationship between freedom of the press and the public interest in justice is similarly a matter of balance

CLAIM sentence:  On the one hand, freedom of expression is integral to the principle of open justice, which encompasses the entitlement of the media to impart and the public to receive information in relation to the process of justice

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore, any restriction on the ability of the press to report proceedings openly must be expressly limited

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, reporting restrictions may be necessary if the right of an individual to a fair trial would be prejudiced by publication of information about the proceedings: this is no more than the protect the integrity of the justice system and a persons right to a fair trial

CLAIM sentence:  Even more fundamental are the limits on freedom of expression necessary to protect a democratic society in which freedom of expression is able to flourish

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, first listed in the restrictions on freedom of expression permitted by Article () are those necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime

CLAIM sentence:  These are straightforward concepts which speak for themselves

CLAIM sentence:  In part, this is because, as discussed in Chapter , unrestricted speech has the power to harm competing public interests, including the free speech of others

CLAIM sentence:  It is also because the press is an institution of considerable power and the exercise of power in a democratic context brings with it proportionate responsibility for the consequences of choices to do so

CLAIM sentence:  Moreover, where power is exercised purportedly in the public interest, then there is a particularly acute responsibility to account for the exercise of that power to the public in whose name it is exercised

CLAIM sentence:  press power and the impact on society 

CLAIM sentence:  In order to understand the responsibilities incumbent on the press, it is necessary to consider the nature of press power and the potential it has to impact on society

CLAIM sentence:  One obvious aspect of the power wielded by the press is its capacity for mass communication: Mass communication has powers that local, individual, communication does not

CLAIM sentence:  Mass communication allows others to criticize, to inform of the failings, crimes, and deceit of the powerful

CLAIM sentence:  Mass communication allows agents to assemble, to unite, to form dissident movements, to organize and oppose those in power

CLAIM sentence:  It is on account of this capacity of the press to communicate to large audiences, that the idea of the megaphone effect of the press was invoked with such frequency throughout the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The megaphone effect of the press has a tremendous capacity to serve the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  It is because of the ability of the press to reach a wide audience that it is taken seriously by, and therefore able to stand up to, other institutions of power

CLAIM sentence:  [O]ne aspect of the public interest in a free press is that it provides an essential set of checks and balances on power (and, more importantly, the abuse of power): in all too many parts of the world the state routinely tortures and murders its citizens, though reporting of such facts is strictly prohibited

CLAIM sentence:  This can help a vicious regime retain an air of legitimacy, or, in some cases, even to present the air of democratic legitimacy (there are putative democracies which have serious restrictions on press freedom)

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, the there is a public interest in learning of dangers and risks, even where others may wish to conceal them

CLAIM sentence:  A powerful industrialist might wish to conceal the fact that his factories are polluting the water supply, or that his companys product is carcinogenic

CLAIM sentence:  A free press, free of the censorship and restrictions imposed by the powerful, thus serves the public interest by its investigative and communicative roles

CLAIM sentence:  Mass communication by the press can block dissenting voices in a number of ways

CLAIM sentence:  One is by preventing access to audiences

CLAIM sentence:  Access to audiences is integral to the ability of individuals to experience the communicative aspects of free speech: Expression can be done by a lone individual, but communication is essentially relational, and involves others

CLAIM sentence:  Communication can be stifled, not by blocking speech, but by blocking access to audiences

CLAIM sentence:  Not only do we have an interest in there being an audience for our speech, we also have an interest in our being the audience to others speech

CLAIM sentence:  Clearly, if a particular individual or group of individuals are denied access to the press to promote their views, their ability to reach audiences is diminished: Writers of such columns in the press can seek to mitigate these criticisms by endeavouring to articulate what they take to be important or widespread lines of thought

CLAIM sentence:  But this still points to the fact that in terms of self-expression the press only allows a select few to promulgate their views

CLAIM sentence:  Although absence of censorship allows others to set up press outlets, in principle the resources required to do this effectively limit this opportunity

CLAIM sentence:  This argument could be taken further and it could be said that the public interest in freedom of expression can even be adversely affected by a free press, if certain other conditions hold such that some voices get much more prominence than others

CLAIM sentence:  In those conditions the power of the press as a medium of expression may lead to certain views dominating the public sphere and other views being squeezed out

CLAIM sentence:  One consequence is that views expressed through the press megaphone are more likely to predominate: Whether somethings liable to be noticed, what effects its liable to have on other peoples perceptions must be very relevant; Financial power ensures that one sort of idea is more likely to be promoted in the newspapers people read than another sort of idea

CLAIM sentence:  The tendency of views expressed in the press to prevail can be also be explained by a second, and related, facet of press power

CLAIM sentence:  There is no doubt that the press is considered a voice of authority in society

CLAIM sentence:  In many quarters, it has rightly earned a reputation for accurate and vigorous reporting, independence and holding power to account

CLAIM sentence:  It is because of the authoritative quality of the press, combined with its access to mass audiences, that  p, ibid  p, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | The Responsibilities of the Press B\xccommunication by the press, as an institution of considerable power, has a significant impact on society

CLAIM sentence:  Media institutions can shape public opinion, they can entrench, or change, public opinion in a way that individual speakers cannot

CLAIM sentence:  The existence of a press with such significant power is a potent antidote to the dominance of big business and government; but it also has potential to do great harm if not exercised with responsibility: If someone in a position of moral or political authority makes a statement about race or about gender, it isnt simply that there will be a wider audience for that but also that the opinion comes with a greater degree of with an imprimatur, or seems to, and that itself is problematic

CLAIM sentence:  Thats why positions of responsibility in society are very difficult, because you have to take a lot of care about what you say because people pay attention to it

CLAIM sentence:  The press has the power to cultivate stereotypes, not just as a matter of the megaphone effect, but by cumulative effect also: there is an asymmetry between the individual case and the case of the press

CLAIM sentence:  One of the reasons we tolerate the fairly broad-ranging right of individual expression is that individuals remarks are typically limited in their impact But this megaphone effect is a kind of culture-shaping effect It exerts much greater influence and power on people, how theyre perceived by others, creating stereotypes or creating certain assumptions in society

CLAIM sentence:   It means that publications in the press are peculiarly vulnerable to promoting stereotypes, because its whats heard is widely heard

CLAIM sentence:  If its assumed that a member of a group is portrayed as a typical member of that group, then attitudes at large towards the group will be affected

CLAIM sentence: \t Communication:\ttruth,\tcomment\tand\tassessability 

CLAIM sentence:  The role of a free press as an agency of free communication (rather than of self-expression), of constituting a public forum of views and ideas, is an important one to focus on

CLAIM sentence:  material that they publish (the message is editorially mediated)

CLAIM sentence:  The vocal power and reach of the press, and its freedoms to mediate, are what make it a mighty force

CLAIM sentence:  A free press performs its communication role in a democracy in a myriad ways, day in and day out

CLAIM sentence:  It is by no means only through political journalism and holding authority to account that the press proves its value in this way (although those are very important aspects in their own right)

CLAIM sentence:  All forms of journalistic content potentially perform this vital role

CLAIM sentence:  It is exactly this multifunctional and multifaceted package of content, produced with such verve and to deadline week in, week out, which makes the press such a marvel, such a matter of pride

CLAIM sentence:  The different functions of the press, though, have different implications

CLAIM sentence:  We care about them in different ways and for different reasons

CLAIM sentence:  We apply different standards to them

CLAIM sentence:  And above all, we want it all to be accessible and a good read, as we all think of that in our different ways

CLAIM sentence:  This communication function is, in other words, an extremely complex and sophisticated exchange between editor and reader

CLAIM sentence:  We want to know the facts, but we also want to know how people experienced them and what people think about them

CLAIM sentence:  We want the spirit as well as the letter of events the emotion, the meaning, the drama, the implications

CLAIM sentence:  We also know about the editorial inflection, the world-view, of the newspaper we read

CLAIM sentence:  We want the news in the press to be true and accurate; we do not want to be misled or lied to

CLAIM sentence:  But we want, or are content for, it to be presented in a partisan way

CLAIM sentence:  We want a measure of balance and context, but we also want a perspective

CLAIM sentence:  We want the truth, but we understand that there are many versions of the truth, and incompleteness in all versions

CLAIM sentence:  Notwithstanding the emphasis put by both the industry and its critics on the difference between fact and comment these are by no means distinct and watertight categories

CLAIM sentence:  All forms of recording are selective

CLAIM sentence:  What authentic communication between editor and reader needs in these circumstances is no more, but no less, than a measure of shared understanding of what is going on in that act of communication

CLAIM sentence:  In most cases, that is easy and obvious

CLAIM sentence:  But in some cases, it will be neither easy nor obvious for readers to orientate themselves in relation to material they read in the press

CLAIM sentence:  Some important examples were put before the Inquiry in the course of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Professor Baroness Onora ONeill, who gave the Inquiry her views as a leading expert in the field of public thinking on the role of the media, describes the need for readers to be able to orientate themselves in relation to what they read as assessability

CLAIM sentence:  Mostly, readers know where they stand with what the papers say, and can make their own minds up about it

CLAIM sentence:  But not always

CLAIM sentence:  Where they cannot do so unaided, more is needed for the press to fulfil its proper role

CLAIM sentence:  This point about the importance of authentic communication by the press, which respects the needs of readers to be able to make their own minds up about what they are reading, was made to the Inquiry in a number of ways

CLAIM sentence:  Examples include: Those who aim to communicate must aspire to standards which are inapplicable for those who aim only to express their own views

CLAIM sentence:   The public interest in a free press is not confined to the public interest in a press that reports matters of fact accurately and observes the disciplines of truth seeking needed for various sorts of inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  It also includes an interest in having a press that communicates other sorts of content eg music and art, puzzles and stories that do not make truth claims

CLAIM sentence:  Nevertheless, where truth claims are made, there is a particularly strong public interest in standards of media communication that meet the relevant requirements for truth seeking accuracy about evidence and its limitations; distinctions between different sorts of evidence; the inclusion of necessary qualifications, and many others

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB\xcbut good public interest journalism seeks to make the sources and the evidence as available to the public as is feasible, given certain other constraints

CLAIM sentence:  I think the default in favour of openness is actually what good journalism does

CLAIM sentence:  They try to give the sources where they can

CLAIM sentence:  The difficulty about confidential sources is the problem that the reader has in knowing (a) was there any source at all and (b) was it a reliable source? One aspect of the public interest is the public interest in truthfulness Here there are two kinds of interest

CLAIM sentence:  There is the direct interest that individuals have in not being deceived or misled

CLAIM sentence:  But there is also a second indirect interest in truthfulness, an interest in maintaining a culture of trust

CLAIM sentence:  If communication is believed to be untruthful (or inaccurate), then trust in communication may diminish

CLAIM sentence:  Simply requiring accuracy or truthfulness does not preclude a free press from misleading, distorting, or, in some cases, from covertly serving or promoting vested interests

CLAIM sentence:  They play the role of communicating facts that have been discovered, established or claimed by others

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence, warrant or other justification for such claims may be lacking, or suspect

CLAIM sentence:  The intermediary may not be competent to assess the claim, or have access to the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Audiences reactions to an article on a new wonder drug that combats cancer might be less favourable if they knew that the copy was verbatim from a press release by the company making the wonder drug

CLAIM sentence:  Ensuring communicative adequacy does not determine or constrain content, except insofar as content is unjustified, misleading and untraceable

CLAIM sentence:  Press ethics, to which the Inquiry was directed by its Terms of Reference, can be understood at a simple level by reference to the choices available to a free press, where those choices may have consequences for the benefit or harm of others, whether individuals, groups or the public as a whole

CLAIM sentence:  These are choices which fall to be made within the framework of the law

CLAIM sentence:  Compliance with the law (criminal, civil and regulatory) does not necessarily exhaust the ethical choices to be made by a free press, nor does consideration of legal risk and consequence exhaust the responsibilities of a press aiming at journalism in the public interest, which takes into account ethical risks and consequences

CLAIM sentence:  The choices that a responsible and ethical press will make, then, flow from precisely those aspects of a free press which give it a unique role and privileges in a democracy, and from an awareness of its power to affect the public in general, and individual members of the public, for better or worse

CLAIM sentence:  (a) (b) (c) (d) If a free press in a democracy has a special role in facilitating free communication and in constituting a public forum, then an ethical press will want to comply with good standards of communication

CLAIM sentence:  It will want to enable people to recognise and assess the material being provided

CLAIM sentence:  Where it provides information, that information will be reasonably intelligible and accurate

CLAIM sentence:  If a free press in a democracy has special privileges to keep its sources secret, then an ethical press will be mindful of the reasons for and effects of that privilege and will exercise it only for those reasons, and bearing in mind those effects

CLAIM sentence:  It will want to ensure that the protection of sources is used to enhance the free flow of significant information and especially to protect those seeking to help hold power to account

CLAIM sentence:  It will not use it merely to constrain or control sources, nor will it abuse the privilege to mask the weakness or absence of sources or the existence of conflicts of interest, or to hide its own wrongdoing

CLAIM sentence:  If a free press in a democracy has a special place because of its ability to hold power to account, an ethical press will consider itself to have responsibilities to do just that

CLAIM sentence:  It will not collude with the powerful at the expense of the public

CLAIM sentence:  It will challenge all kinds of sources of power, both public and private

CLAIM sentence:  It will be mindful of the power of the press itself, and seek to hold that power to account no less than other sources of power

CLAIM sentence:  All such freedoms and choices, after all, stem from the same sources of democratic authority and accountability

CLAIM sentence:  And all ethical systems have at their core a sense of respect for the individuality and self- determination of others

CLAIM sentence:  An ethical press will therefore be especially mindful of the need to ensure that the individuals it deals with, both as sources of information and as the content written about, are treated as subjects and not objects, and both as subjects in their own right and as subjects in context, with families, connections and group identities which may be affected by the treatment of the individual

CLAIM sentence:  All of this is to re-emphasise that the freedom of the press, even the freedom of the press within the limitations and accountabilities under the law, is not enough by itself to secure the important democratic benefits for which press freedom is a prerequisite

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB\xcauthentically free press of the kind valued and privileged in a democracy, the press must also exercise its freedoms effectively for that purpose

CLAIM sentence:  That point was made to the Inquiry in many ways; examples include: The duties or responsibilities of the press follow straightforwardly from the reasons we have for wanting a free press

CLAIM sentence:  So if one of the main reasons for wanting a free press is that we be fully informed as citizens, then there are responsibilities on the press to be accurate, honest, open and accountable

CLAIM sentence:   Clearly though, a press which is free in the sense of not being controlled centrally, not censored, will only be meeting a necessary condition for serving its purposes of informing and scrutinising

CLAIM sentence:  In order for the press to serve these public interests it will also need to pursue its work with accuracy and rigour, to be concerned for the truth, to seek to avoid bias or serving particular interests, to make wise judgments as to what is worthy of public attention and what not, and perhaps to be courageous in pursuing these goals

CLAIM sentence:  (And it may well also be that in order to serve its purpose the press needs to communicate in ways that are intelligible and assessable)

CLAIM sentence:   The strategy here has been to focus on the valuable ends that a free press is meant to serve and then to point out (a) that a free press need not secure those ends; (b) that a free press can even stand as an obstacle to the achievement of those ends

CLAIM sentence:  This is not to argue in favour of censorship but to point out ways in which a free press can fail to contribute towards the public interest, and, as such, public-interest based justifications will fail to apply

CLAIM sentence:   it is important for good judgment that the press is clear not only on the nature of the purposes it serves in a free and democratic society but on their partial contribution to public interest as a whole and the independent significance of other components of the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  In my view the press itself at present assumes too quickly that freedom of the press (and free expression to the extent that is related to press freedom) is sufficient to guarantee that the press serves its distinctive role in contributing to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  On the one hand this is problematic because press freedom is only a necessary condition for the press to make its distinctive contribution to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  Treating it as a sufficient condition is making the press insensitive to all the other factors that are critical to this accuracy and rigour, avoidance of partiality, bias, conflict of interest, and the other factors mentioned above

CLAIM sentence:  But this is also problematic because assuming that a process (a free press) will achieve a beneficial goal allows journalists and editors to fail to address carefully the question of what exactly that distinctive purpose is, or how it relates to other parts of the public interest

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | The Responsibilities of the Press B\xcWhile it is important to protect genuine investigative journalism into matters of public interest it is also important to distinguish the genuine article from purported investigative journalism that ignores or flouts the relevant disciplines of truth seeking, or is not directed at any matters of public interest

CLAIM sentence:  Pseudo public interest journalism discredits the genuine article, is not assessable by its audiences and damages the reputation of the media

CLAIM sentence:   The moral justification for a media organisations rights of expression and communication turns on the role of media organisations rights in constituting a public sphere that gives appropriate status and respect to individual people, and on the related instrumental grounds [of constraining power and enabling democratic deliberation and decision-making]

CLAIM sentence:   The public interest is not just in a free but a diverse press, and also given the presss power and its central role within the public sphere of democratic policy-making an accountable press too

CLAIM sentence:   The fact that the press has certain investigative powers doesnt mean automatically that it has carte blanche to do whatever it wishes to find things out

CLAIM sentence:   Freedom and responsibility are not incompatible notions

CLAIM sentence:  Principally behind the notion of freedom in my account is freedom from censorship, from authorities coming in and telling the press what they may or may not say with respect to output, but they may nonetheless have a number of responsibilities they need to respect in producing those outputs

CLAIM sentence:  I think thats very important

CLAIM sentence:  No, I dont see them as inconsistent

CLAIM sentence:  The point was also made more narrowly, to underline that the freedom of the press, and the value inherent in its freedom to publish, is the beginning and not the end of the questions about the public interest: The fact that freedom of expression is in the public interest and it clearly is it doesnt follow that every instance of expression is in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:   I think a kind of slippage can happen in which this freedom of expression is seen to be the primary public interest the public has in the press, and then that can then seem as liable to trump many of the other side constraints

CLAIM sentence:  So, and if ones a journalist and one values being allowed to write what one thinks is important, theres a kind of, as I say, a natural slippage in which this freedom of expression can be seen to be the dominating aspect of ones code

CLAIM sentence:  I set these thoughts out to underline, and indeed to risk labouring, the point that ethical standards are not inconsistent with a free press but necessary for it fully to realise the value of its freedom

CLAIM sentence:  Ethical standards and behaviour are about valuing the freedom of the press for what it is, and seeking to promote all that is good about that freedom, and not just about  p, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  A free press certainly has choices which it can exercise in ways which undermine the premises of its freedom and work contrary to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  An ethical press will not choose to exercise its freedoms in that way

CLAIM sentence:  With freedom, rights and privilege therefore come choices, and with choices, responsibilities as to how they are exercised and with what consequences

CLAIM sentence:  With choices which affect the public sphere, come also public accountabilities

CLAIM sentence:  The private interests of the press industry, or of organisations within it, can be expected to be strongly aligned with the public interest for just this reason: it is what the free press in a democracy is all about

CLAIM sentence:  But there will also be powerful motivations of a contrary nature to be overcome by an ethical press

CLAIM sentence:  An ethical approach requires a culture of care and awareness, but deadlines are short and time is money

CLAIM sentence:  A diverse and plural press will also be a highly competitive one, contesting among its titles for readership and reputation

CLAIM sentence:  And the pressures of public demand, real or perceived, are by no means a reliable guide to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  This latter point is a well-worn one: the fundamental difference between the public interest and what interests the public

CLAIM sentence:  The argument is sometimes put more subtly: that newspapers should simply meet the demands and expectations they perceive their readers to have or be capable of having in a non-judgmental way, and that the flourishing of newspapers by such means directly supports their ability to fulfil the higher purposes and freedoms of the press

CLAIM sentence:  But this is simply a further restatement of the error that because it is good for the press both to flourish and to be free to make choices, its exercise of those choices in its own perceived interests will itself necessarily be good

CLAIM sentence:   There is no ethical duty at all to provide audiences with whatever they want, even if there are good economic reasons for doing so

CLAIM sentence:   The we are only providing people with what they want may appear to have a whiff of nobility about it, but where peoples wants are vicious, it is little more than an admission of lack of moral sensitivity

CLAIM sentence:   [The idea of the publics right to know] is puzzling and problematic for many reasons

CLAIM sentence:  First, it is not clear what the scope of the right is (right to know what?)

CLAIM sentence:  Second, the very idea of a right to know is problematic

CLAIM sentence:  If it is a negative claim right (no one is permitted to stop me from knowing) then this does not entail any correlative right of publication or communication

CLAIM sentence:  But a positive right to know (others are obliged to ensure that I know) is not feasible: I might not believe them, even if they tell me the truth

CLAIM sentence:  Worst still, it doesnt tell us anything at all about whom the obligation to inform might fall upon

CLAIM sentence:  The commercial interests of the press in supplying or stimulating demands for particular kinds of content are not therefore either identical to, or even necessarily aligned with, the public interest in a free press

CLAIM sentence:  More than that, in an industry with people as its stock in trade, and assuming an evident and growing public appetite for information about other people which is contrary to the public interest because of the way in which it affects the personal autonomy or individual rights of those people, the commercial interests of the press have a clear potential to act contrary to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  They include the instances discussed above in which the private interests of individual journalists, editors or proprietors may be engaged in editorial content in ways which may not be apparent to their readership

CLAIM sentence:  They also include incentives to anti-competitive business practices and cartel behaviour, that is to say practices which may benefit one organisation at the expense of the diversity of the sector as a whole, or which may seek to unite the industry against healthy competitive disciplines and external scrutiny capable of benefiting readers and the public as a whole

CLAIM sentence:  There was some emphasis throughout the Inquiry on the place of ethical codes in supporting an ethical press

CLAIM sentence:  No code of ethics can make an unethical organisation or sector an ethical one

CLAIM sentence:  An unethical organisation will simply find ways round or disregard any code it purports to apply to itself when motivated to do so

CLAIM sentence:  An ethical organisation, on the other hand, will be helped and guided by a code of ethics, but that will be on the basis that the code is simply a clear encapsulation of the values and practices of the organisation in any event

CLAIM sentence:  Professor Christopher Megone, who has worked extensively with industry bodies (mainly in finance and engineering) on issues of workplace ethics, put the matter this way to the Inquiry: Of course an ethical media organisation needs to have an ethical code, one which reflects the distinctive mission of the organisation as part of the press (and thus is aware of the key role of the press regarding the public interest), and one which is sensitive to the particular ethical challenges that may arise for editors, journalists, etc in pursuit of their mission

CLAIM sentence:  The role of owners and editors here will be crucial

CLAIM sentence:  Amongst other things, developing an open culture in a press/media organisation will require sensitivity to the particular kinds of pressure that journalists and other employees are bound to be under

CLAIM sentence:  Against this background, an operative code of ethics therefore would have a number of potential functions

CLAIM sentence:  (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) It would serve as a reminder of the special importance and roles, the freedoms and privileges, the power and responsibilities of the press

CLAIM sentence:  It would, in other words, provide a full context for the choices which fall to be made in practice so that they can be made in accordance with the principles to be derived from this context

CLAIM sentence:  It would, in short, explain what ethical (or, as it is sometimes described, public interest) journalism is

CLAIM sentence:  It would do this not as a matter of rigid and disconnected prescriptions and prohibitions, but by promoting a stable disposition to act in certain ways for the right reasons

CLAIM sentence:  It would recognise and explain the circumstances in which the temptations and motivations to act unethically (including commercial motivations) may be especially strong, and why they need to be resisted, in order to change the incentive structure in such cases

CLAIM sentence:  It would not expect to stand alone

CLAIM sentence:  It would take its place in a context of ethical culture, sources of advice and guidance both generally and at the particular levels of training, reinforcement, management and feedback

CLAIM sentence:  It would be authoritative and respected

CLAIM sentence:  It would have consequences in terms of how individuals and organisations are perceived, in terms of rewards and sanctions

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry asked a number of its witnesses specifically, and through its website the public more generally, what would be the distinguishing features of the culture and practices of a media industry, or any organisation which was a part of that industry, which would make it a recognisably ethical one

CLAIM sentence: pdf pg , line  - pg , line   Chapter  | The Responsibilities of the Press B\xcBaroness ONeills suggested six principles of openness for identifying ethical journalism which seem to me to have much to recommend them: (a) openness about payments from others (b) openness about payments to others (c) openness about the interests (financial or otherwise) of owners, editors, programme- makers and journalists (d) openness about errors (e) openness about (most) sources, with an adequately drawn test of the public interest to allow sources to be kept secret, for specific reasons and in particular situations openness about comments from members of the public

CLAIM sentence:  It is also worth setting out extracts from some of the answers to this question which appear to me to be particularly illuminative

CLAIM sentence:  I mean, rather, a media industry whose members and whose regulatory framework, while driven by a range of diverse goals that are not necessarily ethical in a narrow sense, are nonetheless deeply sensitive to the industrys pivotal role in the liberal public sphere A free press within an ethical media industry in this sense would have the following features, among others: a sense of journalism as a profession with its own aims and values, including respect for the truth, respect for those about whom the press writes, respect for readers; poor practices (unethical, illegal, or contrary to the reasons supporting press freedom) are regarded as shameful and their practitioners are ashamed of them;- whistle-blowers are supported; journalists, editors and proprietors grasp the complexity of the moral role of the press (as, perhaps, politicians since the expenses scandal grasp the moral complexity of their own role); the wider public is willing to pay the comparatively high costs (e

CLAIM sentence:  of ethical investigative methods) to support a press that upholds a liberal public sphere

CLAIM sentence:  Such a code needs to be presented in the context of the specific critical contribution that a free press can make to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The code could then be developed in terms of the duties to the key parties with whom the press/media interact in ethically relevant ways

CLAIM sentence:  A code by itself is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is a lived code

CLAIM sentence:  The reports might reflect both on the ethical culture of the organisation and on the organisations contribution to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The Editor- in-Chief of the Mail titles, Paul Dacre, identified these risks, and the challenges the Inquiry faces, in this way: 

CLAIM sentence:  The public interest in a press which is free, which is viable, and which is diverse cannot be too highly valued

CLAIM sentence:  Without investigative journalism, and the ability of the press to scour hidden places, the domain of the powerful, for potential wrongdoing, our democracy would be severely impoverished

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction The Inquiry is required to examine the culture, practices and ethics of the press but, in order to do that, it is helpful to set out the commercial context within which the press operates

CLAIM sentence:  This includes both the economic models and market pressures, but also the regulatory environment within which they operate

CLAIM sentence:  Again, this is important context for subsequent analysis

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, Chapter  looks at the way in which competition law specifically applies to the press and the media, providing a brief history of media ownership and plurality provisions and how they currently apply

CLAIM sentence:  These changes mean that the commercial environment in which the press is operating is quite different to that in which the current self-regulatory regime was first established

CLAIM sentence:  National newspaper circulation stood at over  million for the national daily newspapers and nearly  million for the Sunday papers

CLAIM sentence:  The picture now is very different

CLAIM sentence:  All media organisations, whether newspapers, broadcasters, or others now have some form of established internet presence, and the internet has opened up access to UK citizens to news coverage from across the world; some of this is from professional media organisations, but it also includes citizen journalism from individuals sharing their experience of, and views on, events that occur

CLAIM sentence:  As Claire Enders explained at one of the Inquiry seminars in October , the declines since  and the Calcutt report have been biggest in the popular national press and the regional press, both falling by over % while the quality national press have seen falls of only % over that timescale

CLAIM sentence:  However, the decline has accelerated since ; that period has seen the whole of the % post-Calcutt fall in circulation of the quality nationals, while the popular nationals have fallen only by % in that time scale

CLAIM sentence: pdf - cited as being cc from data in Advertising Statistics Yearbook   http://stakeholders

CLAIM sentence:  In the national press the main revenue streams are overwhelmingly sales revenue and display advertising: 

CLAIM sentence: % in popular press and only % in the regional press, where classified advertising makes   daily figures from http://media

CLAIM sentence: uk/abcs-three-national-dailies-increase-circulation-september  Chapter  | ContextC\xcup 

CLAIM sentence: % of revenue

CLAIM sentence:  Both copy sales and display advertising revenue streams are under pressure

CLAIM sentence:  Competition for display advertising spend is marked, with much advertising moving online

CLAIM sentence:  billion in the first half of 

CLAIM sentence:  More dramatically, print classified advertising has been particularly hard hit by the move to online

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, revenues accrued through recruitment advertising have reduced from  million per year to  million per year, and there has been a similar decline in property advertising

CLAIM sentence:  Recruiters simply do not need to place print advertisements any more

CLAIM sentence:  Further, public sector advertising, once a source of considerable revenue for both regional and national press, has also largely moved online with significant implications for the revenues of newspaper businesses

CLAIM sentence:  The editors of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish newspapers who have given evidence said that advertising revenues were particularly important for the smaller circulation papers, and emphasised the impact of the loss of advertising from the public sector for those smaller papers

CLAIM sentence:  Although the proportion of advertising online spend has grown at a considerable rate, those revenues are shared by a far greater number of businesses including micro bloggers and other online businesses

CLAIM sentence:  Although the internet enables highly personalised targeted advertising, for which advertisers will pay a premium, such revenues derived from advertising directed at specific types of user, so-called targeted or behavioural advertising, have not in any way matched the decline in revenue from traditional sources

CLAIM sentence:  This advertising is driven by the availability of vast quantities of data, both personal and more general, that users upload when they make online purchases, or through anonymised tracking of individuals ISPs and other providers when users browse the internet

CLAIM sentence:  This model has served the internet industry and users well to a point

CLAIM sentence:  It is common ground that falling revenues and the increased need to produce copy  hours a day has resulted in fewer journalists having to do more work

CLAIM sentence:  Editors have argued that the financial levels affect staffing levels but that this simply means that journalists work harder and that there is no reduction in the quality of journalism

CLAIM sentence:  Others have suggested that the effect of journalists having to produce more stories in less time and with less resource is that material is not as thoroughly checked as it once was, press releases are reproduced uncritically and stories are recycled around the media with little development or additional checking

CLAIM sentence:  Across the press the same challenge faces all titles in respect of how to make money from content online in a world where advertising revenues and revenues from physical circulation continue to decline, whilst readership online is growing

CLAIM sentence:  That is not to say that, as is clear from Chapter  in this Part, there are not parts of the UK press that are profitable and, in some cases, highly profitable

CLAIM sentence:  Annual conference In addition to its media interests, News Corp also plays a role in public policy discussion, organising and hosting an annual Management Conference, the aim of which is to provide a forum for the discussion of media issues and policy in relation to world events

CLAIM sentence:  The conference is not only for News Corps senior executives and journalists but also for policy makers and other interested parties

CLAIM sentence:  The conference has been held in Cancun, Mexico, and Hayman Island, Australia, as well as Pebble Beach, California

CLAIM sentence:  The News Corp Management Conference is a private event, and in so far as can be established, no records of the meetings are made available

CLAIM sentence:  Speakers have included Rupert Murdoch, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tony Blair, ex-President Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Senator John McCain and the Israeli President, Shimon Peres

CLAIM sentence:  This was the first title to have been launched rather than bought by the UK subsidiary

CLAIM sentence:  The Sun also sees itself as a campaigning newspaper, championing causes it considers important to its readers such as the Help for Heroes campaign

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch described the brand of NoTW as: an investigative newspaper with exposes and the like, wasnt only concerned with celebrities and salacious gossip, but also uncovering real wrongdoing, scandals, campaigning and so on and so forth

CLAIM sentence:  The two newspapers were published as sister titles from that date until the closure of NoTW on  July 

CLAIM sentence:  This new approach to tabloid journalism was well illustrated in the publication in NoTW of Christine Keelers memoir of the  Profumo affair

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, some commentators have suggested this was a, if not the, defining moment in the development of a journalistic ethos at what was to become NI

CLAIM sentence:  Innovations in content intended to appeal to a mass market included the introduction of television coverage, and the advent of the first Page  girl in 

CLAIM sentence:  Although these changes were criticised by some within the industry at the time and, indeed, led to a bitter and protracted dispute with both the print unions and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), commentators have credited these changes, which have since been adopted by all newspapers, with ensuring the economic viability of the British newspaper industry

CLAIM sentence:  NIs move to Wapping and decision to face down the print unions, had strong support in Government

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, throughout the strike in the mid-s, NI was able to maintain almost full production and distribution capabilities as well as a complement of leading journalists

CLAIM sentence:  The company was therefore content to allow the dispute to run its course

CLAIM sentence:  With many thousands of workers having gone without pay for over a year, the strike eventually collapsed on  February 

CLAIM sentence:  It has been suggested that the defeat of the unions would not have been possible without the support of the Conservative Government of the time

CLAIM sentence:  Faced with escalating productions costs and a commercial model that was under increasing threat, the Thomson Organisation decided to put both titles up for sale at the end of 

CLAIM sentence:  NI reached an agreement with Thomson to acquire those papers

CLAIM sentence:  Further, and subject to two exceptions, the Secretary of State was prohibited from giving his consent to such a merger unless he had first received a report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC)

CLAIM sentence:  He therefore gave his consent for the merger to go ahead, but he also imposed eight conditions: First, the newspapers are to be published as separate newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  Fifth, the editor of each newspaper shall retain control over any political comment published in his newspaper and, in particular, shall not be subject to any restraint or inhibition in expressing opinion or in reporting news that might directly or indirectly conflict with the opinions or interests of any of the newspaper proprietors

CLAIM sentence:  Sixth, instructions to journalists shall be given only by the editor or those to whom he has delegated authority

CLAIM sentence:  Eighth, disputes between the editors and directors of the companies are to be settled by the independent national directors

CLAIM sentence:  The decision of the Secretary of State was controversial

CLAIM sentence:  The Labour MP, John Smith, called an emergency debate on the decision on the day that the Secretary of States consent was announced

CLAIM sentence:  The Opposition, and indeed some Government backbenchers, argued that the threat of closure was a device concocted by Thomson and colluded in by NI designed to force the Governments hand

CLAIM sentence:  There were also allegations that the Prime Minister had influenced the Secretary of States decision as a favour to Rupert Murdoch

CLAIM sentence:  Although The Times has a reputation for taking a generally conservative approach to matters of public policy and social issues, its support for political parties at general elections has varied

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has also been informed that the editors of The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun will be required to attend these monthly NI Board meetings and report on performance and compliance

CLAIM sentence:  No information has been provided on past corporate governance practice at NI or governance procedures at NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  The Corporate Audit Department of News Corp provides assurance on the effectiveness of operational and financial controls through audits carried out on the basis of an assessment of significant risks to News Corp

CLAIM sentence:  The TNHL Board must comprise no more than  directors of whom at least six must be Independent National Directors

CLAIM sentence:  Over the same period NIs salary bill has been reduced from 

CLAIM sentence:  However, overall staff costs at NI have increased from

CLAIM sentence:  Until  it was the only satellite serving the UK

CLAIM sentence:  BSB was required by its licence to use a different technology to that then successfully in use by Sky, and was bedevilled by technical problems, not being able to launch until March 

CLAIM sentence:  The Bill placed a number of licence conditions (impartiality and accuracy of news; not offending against good taste or decency; not inciting crime or disorder; and not offending against public feeling) on BSB, but not on Sky

CLAIM sentence:  In practical terms this would have required NI to divest the Sky Channel, but might also have had an implication for other publishers who held stakes in BSB

CLAIM sentence:  The Home Office was formally notified of the merger on  November , with a formal public announcement being made by the two companies, and the merger taking place, on  November, resulting in the creation of BSkyB

CLAIM sentence:  Under the  Act an IBA contract for satellite broadcasting could be ended or suspended by the IBA or the Secretary of State if a newspaper proprietor had an interest in a contractor and the existence of those shareholdings has led, or is leading to results which are contrary to the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  The IBA was not informed of the merger in advance of it taking place

CLAIM sentence:  Under the terms of BSBs contract with the IBA it was obliged to get the approval of the regulator for any merger

CLAIM sentence:  That approval was not sought in advance

CLAIM sentence:  The growth of the MailOnline, now the most popular newspaper website in the world, is also testament to the enduring appeal of the breadth of content, and in particular, celebrity news, offered by the Mail newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  Viscount Rothermere has described the MailOnline as having made a global footprint

CLAIM sentence:  The Mail has traditionally been politically conservative, supporting the Conservative Party at every general election since 

CLAIM sentence:  A&N Media includes Associated Newspapers, which publishes UK national newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  Associated Newspapers is highly profitable and employs over , staff

CLAIM sentence:  In the / financial year, Associated Newspapers had revenues of m, with an operating profit of m

CLAIM sentence:  This makes Associated Newspapers by some way the most successful newspaper concern in the UK in purely cash terms, to say nothing of the global reach of its online content

CLAIM sentence:  The picture would be incomplete without some reference to the phenomenal growth of the MailOnline

CLAIM sentence:  However, the MailOnline reproduces much of the content published in the printed titles, in addition to its own, often US focused content

CLAIM sentence:  Our focus here is on A&N Media, and within that on Associated Newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  A&N Media also includes Northcliffe Media

CLAIM sentence:  In addition the Information Security Committee includes within its remit responsibility for data protection in the company, including third party data held by the company

CLAIM sentence:  The DMGT Board are not involved in the editorial process, nor do they have any proprietorial influence on published content

CLAIM sentence:  The editors of Associated Newspapers have complete editorial independence over the content published in individual DMGT titles

CLAIM sentence:  The editors of Associated Newspapers report to the Chair of DMGT and the editor-in-chief, not to the commercial management of the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  New systems of approving and recording payments to third parties were established at Associated Newspapers following the introduction of the Bribery Act 

CLAIM sentence:  These require: prior approval from department heads; documentation of the payment; an explanation of why the payment is necessary, including any public interest issue where appropriate; and where it involves an employee acting against their employer, the information presented must be assessed as well as justified

CLAIM sentence:  This system applies to freelance journalists working at Associated Newspapers when they need to make payments to third parties in pursuit of a story for the company

CLAIM sentence:  These could be fees to freelancers (either for information or for journalism), fees to the public for information, fees to the public for the right to tell their story, or fees to the public for pictures

CLAIM sentence:  Payments can be made in cash in a limited number of circumstances, and can be to anonymous sources

CLAIM sentence:  Each desk will have delegated authority to approve payments up to an agreed level

CLAIM sentence:  Above that level, the approval of the editor or deputy editor is required

CLAIM sentence:  In this respect, the company ensures that presence of the managing editors on the newsroom floor is constant

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Dacre said that: If, for example, a reporter was asked to do something he or she was unhappy about, or a head of department was unhappy about signing off payment, there is no reason why they would not feel able to discuss this with the managing editors ANL also has a Data Protection Policy, and a staff handbook which includes a whistleblowers procedure and a speak up policy

CLAIM sentence:  The Northern and Shell staff handbook also includes a requirement that employees should comply with any company policies in force in this regard

CLAIM sentence:  It also includes a requirement that staff should seek to minimise the risk of expensive and damaging legal action

CLAIM sentence:  Although Northern and Shell is not a member of the PCC, the legal team expect to work in accordance with the standards set down in the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Rather than responding to complaints made by members of the public or by affected parties through the PCC, instead Northern and Shell has established a Committee, comprising all the editors, the Group Editorial Director and the legal department, which sits on an ad hoc basis to look at any complaints received relating to the companys publications

CLAIM sentence:  At present, there are no specific documents setting out the policies around anti-bribery or information gathering

CLAIM sentence:  GMG is wholly owned by the Scott Trust, who appoints, and can remove, the editor of the Guardian

CLAIM sentence:  This is to ensure the independence of the readers editor from senior operational staff at the Guardian and the editor-in-chief

CLAIM sentence:  Guardian boards The Board of the Scott Trust comprises ten directors

CLAIM sentence:  The directors meet quarterly and also meet annually with the full Board of GMG

CLAIM sentence:  The Board also comprises five Independent Directors

CLAIM sentence:  The GMG Board is briefed on a monthly basis by the editor-in chief on editorial strategy and implementation, budgets, capital expenditure, industrial relations issues, significant stories and press coverage of the group

CLAIM sentence:  Payments to freelance journalists are processed by administrators using a bespoke payments system

CLAIM sentence:  If a claim exceeds the limits set by the relevant policies, claims are referred to the managing editor for further scrutiny

CLAIM sentence:  The GNM Code includes a number of issues not covered by the Editors Code of Practice (e

CLAIM sentence:  conflicts of interest and declarations) and also offers more comprehensive guidance than the Editors Code of Practice on a number of matters including privacy

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the GNM Code also sets out a series of questions, including engaging the the Omand Principles, which should be considered by journalists whenever privacy issues are potentially engaged

CLAIM sentence:  These are: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) There must be sufficient cause the intrusion needs to be justified by the scale of the harm that might result from it; There must be integrity of motive the intrusion must be justified in terms of the public good that would follow from publication; the methods used must be in proportion to the seriousness of the story and its public interest, using the minimum possible intrusion; there must be proper authority any intrusion must be authorised at a sufficiently senior level and with appropriate oversight; there must be a reasonable prospect of success fishing expeditions are not justified

CLAIM sentence:  The remainder of the board directors of GNM and GMG are accountable to the CEO

CLAIM sentence:  Guardian readers editors 

CLAIM sentence:  Both the Guardian and the Observer have readers editors

CLAIM sentence:  The contact details of the readers editor of both titles are published in each edition of the respective newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  As noted above, the Guardian is one of very few newspapers to employ a readers editor

CLAIM sentence:  The role of the readers editor is to correct or clarify inaccuracies, discuss issues raised by readers and liaise with an external Ombudsman

CLAIM sentence:  On occasion, when the editor might disagree with the judgment of the readers editor, the views of the former may be taken into account, but ultimately the editor has no power to change the outcome of the readers editors findings

CLAIM sentence:  However, there is a consultation process with the editor, the managing editor and the  pp-, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The readers editor may also refer any substantial grievances to the external Ombudsman

CLAIM sentence:  The Ombudsmans role is to review the process of review conducted by the Readers Editor in carrying out the initial investigation

CLAIM sentence:  What hes trying to assess is whether the readers editor has done it fairly and competently

CLAIM sentence:  The Evening Standard Limited is also owned by the Lebedevs, having been purchased in January 

CLAIM sentence:  Evgeny Lebedev told the Inquiry that his focus for both newspaper titles is the provision of accurately informed journalism, which is ethically sound and delivered in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  He said that although his papers might adopt different approaches and have different political leanings, the broader purpose of both titles remains dedicated to fair and accurate journalism

CLAIM sentence:   He has said further that this commitment to high quality journalism is reflected in the content published by the newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent did not adopt a party political position at the two general elections that followed its launch but supported Labour at the  electon

CLAIM sentence:  In subsequent elections it has switched its support between the Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties

CLAIM sentence:  History The Independent was founded in  by the journalists Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen Glover and Brett Straub, and was published by Newspaper Publishing plc

CLAIM sentence:  The creation of the new paper took place against the background of the Wapping disputes

CLAIM sentence:  Although The Independent enjoyed initial success, and had achieved a circulation in excess of , by , by the early s its readership had declined and the paper was struggling financially

CLAIM sentence:  By , The Independent was reporting losses of m per year, and in , following staff cuts, and in order to make further cost savings, the title moved to Northcliffe House, the headquarters of Associated Newspapers, where the two groups shared a number of services (though editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate)

CLAIM sentence:  In March , it was announced that the Lebedevs company would be buying The Independent

CLAIM sentence:  These are things the Independent has always done well and will, I hope, continue to do

CLAIM sentence:  A separate newspaper, the i was launched in October , aimed at readers and lapsed readers of all ages and commuters with limited time

CLAIM sentence:  Priced at p it has quickly overtaken The Independent in circulation

CLAIM sentence:  In February , the circulation of The Independent stood at ,

CLAIM sentence:  Its sister paper i has more than twice the circulation, at ,

CLAIM sentence:  The Board is also attended by the Company Secretary and Finance Director

CLAIM sentence:  The Finance Director and Company Secretary of IPL has emphasized the importance of transparency of editorial payments to the Boards overall corporate and financial governance functions

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent has in place clear procedures that govern all financial transactions made by staff at the company

CLAIM sentence:  Under this system, payments to casual staff are authorised by the relevant Department Head and have to be approved by the Financial Controller or the Senior Management Accountant

CLAIM sentence:  Contributions payments (made to freelancers, photographs etc) are made on the payments system and checked by the Finance Department with levels of authorisation required dependent on the amount concerned

CLAIM sentence:  The Financial Controller and Senior Management Accountant authorise such payments

CLAIM sentence:  Expenses have to be authorised by department heads, and editorial expenses must be authorised by the Managing Editor

CLAIM sentence:  No advances are made for UK based expenses

CLAIM sentence:  Internal controls are overseen by the office of the managing editor, who ensures that any payments which are made are: proper, are substantiated and, if appropriate, that there is a receipt to support them

CLAIM sentence:  IPL has recently introduced a Code of Conduct which brings together a number of policy matters in one document

CLAIM sentence:  It also goes into the use of hospitality and guidance and policies around that

CLAIM sentence:  The creation of the Code was triggered by the enactment of the Bribery Act

CLAIM sentence:  IPL has also restated its insistence on staff compliance with the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  The IPL Code of Conduct also includes a policy on whistle-blowing, which encourages employees to report concerns without fear of reprisal

CLAIM sentence:  IPL also has a clear disciplinary policy which sets out that employees who are found to have committed acts of gross misconduct are liable for dismissal

CLAIM sentence:  Acts of gross misconduct includes theft, dishonesty or deliberate falsification of documents, unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information and a serious act which breaks mutual trust and confidence or which brings or is likely to bring IPL into disrepute

CLAIM sentence:  Other than these guidelines, there are no specific policies in place in relation to the payment for information

CLAIM sentence:  Letters to the editor are handled between the editor and the managing editor, in the absence of a readers editor

CLAIM sentence:  The FT group is profitable and has shown growth in profits over the period -

CLAIM sentence:  Pearson PLC publishes a Code of Conduct which requires all Pearson employees (and therefore all FT employees) to conduct themselves in accordance with the law and with the ethical principles set out in that Code

CLAIM sentence:  All Pearson employees are reminded of the Code on an annual basis and required to confirm compliance or identify cases of non-compliance

CLAIM sentence:  Pearson employees can report breaches of the Code to their manager or in-house legal team

CLAIM sentence:  FT employees are asked by management to sign up to the terms of the Editors Code of Practice and are asked to declare any financial interests in a share register

CLAIM sentence:  Evidence has been submitted that demonstrates % of FT employees had done so

CLAIM sentence:  It is the intention of the FT to require all employees to sign up to compliance with the Editors Code on an annual basis

CLAIM sentence:  Pearson also operates a whistle-blowing hotline called Ethicspoint which allows employees to report breaches of the Pearson code on an anonymous basis

CLAIM sentence:  He also told the Inquiry that the managing editor operates an open-door policy for staff who may wish to raise any HR issues, and works together with the Financial Times union, to whom individuals can also bring grievances

CLAIM sentence:  The FT also has in place an anti Bribery and Corruption policy, introduced after the Bribery Act 

CLAIM sentence:  Where an employee might have a concern relating to bribery or corruption at the FT, they are required to raise it with their immediate manager or with the in-house legal or internal audit teams, or to use Ethicspoint to report their concerns, should they wish to do so anonymously

CLAIM sentence:  The FT has policies in place regarding approval of payments to third parties and payment of expenses to employees

CLAIM sentence:  In both cases expenditure within agreed budgets and spending limits are approved by the individual incurring the expenditure and on the basis of appropriate evidence of the expenditure

CLAIM sentence:  The FT states that it does not pay sources for stories, though sometimes reasonable expenses, such as travel, may be reimbursed, though no specific incidences are recalled

CLAIM sentence:  The managing editor is also responsible for administering the Investment Register, an internal procedure which ensures that the investment interests of editorial staff are appropriately disclosed

CLAIM sentence:  There are no financial incentives for the editor related to the production of exclusive stories

CLAIM sentence:  Significantly, % of those who read a regional newspaper do not read a national newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  Advertising is predominantly in two different forms, display advertising and classified advertising

CLAIM sentence: % of revenues in the national press

CLAIM sentence:  Overall advertising revenues in the regional press have fallen steeply, from a high of ,m in  to ,m in 

CLAIM sentence:  This is a much steeper decline in advertising revenues than has been seen in the national press or in consumer magazines

CLAIM sentence:  The decline in advertising revenue has been largely driven by competition from the internet

CLAIM sentence:  Classified advertising, in particular, has moved online, with the share of classified advertising online rising from % in  to over % in , and the printed press share falling commensurately from % to under % in the same timeframe

CLAIM sentence:  That trend is predicted to continue, with the internet accounting for over % of classified advertising by 

CLAIM sentence:  Display advertising has also moved online, but the trend is not as marked as is the case with classified advertising

CLAIM sentence:  The effect of the economic downturn has meant, for instance that whereas at its peak Trinity Mirror had seen m in revenue from recruitment advertising, this figure had reduced to m last year

CLAIM sentence:  million unique users every month and is growing, and I think the challenge for all of us is how we can make more money out of that

CLAIM sentence:  Over recent years the regional and national press has been concerned about, and lobbied on, a number of public policy issues that impact on them

CLAIM sentence:  The regime is also flexible in that it can take account of valid failing firm arguments, as well as efficiencies and any other benefits to customers brought about through a merger

CLAIM sentence:  The OFT noted that it was able only to consider consumer benefits and that Ofcom was not able to guarantee that in the longer term any benefits arising from the transaction would accrue to consumers rather than to shareholders

CLAIM sentence:  The OFT also said that they had not been shown any compelling evidence that in the absence of the transaction the titles would all continue to exist as economic going concerns

CLAIM sentence:  The OFT therefore concluded on  October  that the merger should be referred to the Competition Commission

CLAIM sentence:  However, this issue has not been covered in any detail by the Inquiry and, although the extent and nature of the problem has been made clear, the Inquiry has heard no evidence as to how it might be addressed

CLAIM sentence:  I recognise that there is no simple solution to this issue

CLAIM sentence:  I also recognise that many efforts have been made over the years to try to find a solution, and that many of the options for public support that have been canvassed are not appropriate

CLAIM sentence:  This does not make the need to find a solution any less urgent

CLAIM sentence: bn copies sold or distributed annually, and consumers spending some 

CLAIM sentence:  ABC monitors some  consumer magazines published by  publishers with a total circulation of ,,

CLAIM sentence:  Other magazines circulated to members of particular associations (for example, Saga or RSPB) have very high individual circulation

CLAIM sentence:  Most of these consumer magazines are specialist interest titles of varying sorts and are not engaged in the sort of news and current affairs reporting, or reporting on individuals, with which the Inquiry is primarily concerned

CLAIM sentence:  This confidence was echoed by the editors of Heat, OK! and Hello! Magazines when they gave evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Consent is therefore freely offered in most cases for the publication of such content

CLAIM sentence:  Such material is subject to the same processes of verification that the Inquiry has been told is common to all newsrooms; checks are made by sub-editors, senior editors and the legal department

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to requiring staff to abide by the terms of the Editors Code of Practice, Heat Magazine also require staff to adhere to the Bauer Groups Best Practice Guidelines

CLAIM sentence:  The Bauer Group Best Practice Guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis and circulated to the newsroom

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Cave told the Inquiry that content is subject to routine checks by editors during the publication process, and external lawyers provide advice on an ad hoc basis as appropriate

CLAIM sentence:  The title also has an online website, which is independent from the magazine and is edited by a separate editor

CLAIM sentence:  These are agreed in advance with the celebrities or public figures concerned

CLAIM sentence:  The title also does not have a formal policy in relation to payments to external sources, but Ms Nixon told the Inquiry that as a rule it does not make cash payments for any information

CLAIM sentence:  C Introduction For centuries the printed press was the only medium that brought news to the people

CLAIM sentence:  The introduction of broadcasting in the s brought a new voice, but one that had a very different relationship with the public than that of the newspapers with their readers

CLAIM sentence:  Technological changes in the last few decades have completely revolutionised the market in which newspapers are working, leading to the fragmentation not only in readership and advertising but also the introduction of news providers that are not currently a part of the self-regulatory, or indeed any other regulatory, regime

CLAIM sentence:  The kinds [sic] of stories we do are different

CLAIM sentence:  In matters of privacy, our focus, when there is a debate about intrusions of privacy, are, I think without exception, in a journalistic context, around investigations into matters which I think everyone would accept were of public interest

CLAIM sentence:  we dont do any investigations into peoples private lives for their own sake

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC meets its public purpose obligations, set out in the Royal Charter, through the distribution of information, education and entertainment

CLAIM sentence:  Certain programmes, particularly those which rely on investigative journalism, also have to abide by relevant individual handbooks

CLAIM sentence:  Data Protection is overseen by the Information and Compliance Unit

CLAIM sentence:  There is also a Central Compliance Unit (also established in ) which is responsible for monitoring, improving and reporting on the BBCs compliance obligations

CLAIM sentence:  The Compliance Unit is not responsible for delivering compliance but is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate framework is in place to minimise compliance failures

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore, the regulatory jurisdiction of the Trust and Ofcom overlap in respect of this content

CLAIM sentence:  However, the BBC Trust assesses the market impact of non-services in-house (applying a Public Value Test)

CLAIM sentence:  There is a clear delegation of function to Ofcom in relation to the assessment of the market impact of the BBCs commercial activities

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom also exercises a role of oversight in relation to the editorial content of BBC output, specifically in relation to privacy and fairness

CLAIM sentence:  I think my job is to to not just to sit on top of a management machine and try and optimise it for editorial compliance thats, you know, in a senses, part of what one has to do to try and get the right result but also to take responsibility for what the BBC broadcast and also to take personal responsibility for occasions when we have fallen short of our high standards

CLAIM sentence:  None of this is a matter for this Inquiry, and there are separate inquiries into the specific issues

CLAIM sentence:  The Trust does not have a role in handling or adjudicating upon individual complaints in the first instance, unless the complaint is concerning the act or omission of the Trust itself

CLAIM sentence:  Complaints that relate to fairness or privacy can also be made to Ofcom, in line with their regulatory jurisdiction over this form of content

CLAIM sentence:  Although the complainant can submit complaints relating to impartiality or accuracy issues to Ofcom, it is unlikely that Ofcom would entertain these types of complaints

CLAIM sentence:  Concerns were also raised about the correction of mistakes made online on the BBC website

CLAIM sentence:  I think were currently at , per cent of that target, and in, again, the overwhelming majority of cases, the complaint is satisfactorily dealt with at that stage

CLAIM sentence:   This manual is the centrepiece guidance issued to staff at ITN and forms the basis of ITN staff training

CLAIM sentence:  ITN recently reviewed its Compliance Manual in light of allegations of phone hacking, as well as allegations of payments to public officials by journalists and others working at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  I dont think theres been substantive changes as a result of this Inquiry but it also includes a lot of updates on other issues, such as Twittering in court or online posting, so its an update

CLAIM sentence:  He has said that consideration is given as a matter course to issues of privacy, consent, and public interest; all of which are built into the ITN Compliance Manual

CLAIM sentence:  He noted that, on average, ten complaints might be received in the course of a given year, and not all of these would be of a substantial nature

CLAIM sentence:  the World Wide Web 

CLAIM sentence:  At its simplest the Internet is a system of interconnected computer networks which use a standardised address system to enable the identification of each of the electronic devices that make up the network

CLAIM sentence:  It also means that the services that media providers can offer through the Internet to consumers can be ever more sophisticated, personalised and immediate

CLAIM sentence:  The Internet also enables citizens to access news generated by sources across the world

CLAIM sentence:  Most of that content is available for free, although some, including some UK publishers, have begun to charge for online content

CLAIM sentence:  This free content can be accessed directly where the user knows what they are looking for, or can be found through search engines

CLAIM sentence:  Where a site is acting as an aggregator, it directs users to material created by others

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the presence that traditional providers have on the internet, recent years have also seen the growth of completely new approaches to news generation and provision

CLAIM sentence:  Regulation of the Internet In evidence to the Inquiry, the Internet has been described as an unregulated space, in which businesses can avoid the regulation of a given jurisdiction by hosting the content they publish in a different legal jurisdiction

CLAIM sentence:  Witnesses have pointed to the publication of photos of, in particular, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, which though different in terms of the surrounding circumstances, highlight issues around the existence of different jurisdictions and regulatory regimes as applied to the press and the Internet

CLAIM sentence:  To some extent, this is an accurate if very cursory reflection of the regulatory picture with regard to the Internet

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is a simplification that ignores what is a more complex picture

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly, the very nature of the Internet does not lend itself to regulation

CLAIM sentence:  This does not mean, however, that the Internet is without any governing principles

CLAIM sentence:  To ensure interoperability of the constituent networks, as well as consistent policy on addressing, addresses and standards are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), based in California, at which the UK Government is represented

CLAIM sentence:  Access to Internet services is also regulated in the UK and Europe through telecommunications legislation as regulated by Ofcom

CLAIM sentence:  Internet services have predominantly been provided through the national copper wire telecoms network

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, just as the general law applies online as it does offline, some forms of online content are also regulated

CLAIM sentence:  The necessary powers for the regulation of these services are delegated to ATVOD by Ofcom through a formal designation

CLAIM sentence:  In many circumstances, ISPs and others have cooperated with law enforcement and other agencies to remove illegal content or block access to it

CLAIM sentence:  The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is an example of this self- regulatory approach

CLAIM sentence:  The current reliance on collaborative approaches and industry self-regulation does not mean that enforcement of UK law online is not possible

CLAIM sentence:  However, successful prosecution relies on considerable cooperation across a number of agencies, not least the ISPs and content  pp-, paragraphs -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In , Lancashire County Council also worked with Twitter to identify and bring prosecutions against individuals suspected of tax avoidance

CLAIM sentence:  This relative lack of internet specific regulation is unlikely to change

CLAIM sentence:  The Government made clear that it sees the Internet as a key driver of future economic growth and innovation, and has made public its commitment to an open but responsible Internet

CLAIM sentence:  This should be understood as an internet in which all legal content is available and there is no blocking of sites or discriminatory practice (such as prioritising one very similar product over another), and where the industry works together with Government to deliver solutions to issues particularly in relation to: e-Accessibility; harmful and inappropriate content; and copyright

CLAIM sentence:  Where legislation has been brought forward in relation to the Internet, this has been in response to legislative changes decided at a European level, intended to protect the privacy of users

CLAIM sentence:  Changes to the law have extended the powers available to the Information Commissioners Office to ensure that it has appropriate tools to do its job effectively in a digital age

CLAIM sentence:  In this respect Google has worked hard to improve public awareness of privacy issues online, and in January  launched the good to know campaign which actively sought to raise public awareness of privacy tools in relation to email, social network accounts and other online functions that might help users to protect their privacy online

CLAIM sentence:  Camilla Wright, co-founder of Popbitch, told the Inquiry that her intention in founding Popbitch was to create a publication like Private Eye for the celebrity world that would: 

CLAIM sentence:  look at the hypocritical gap between how those in the public eye seek to be portrayed and how they really act

CLAIM sentence:  There is no single format for these types of sites and individual sites can evolve, and have evolved, a great deal over time

CLAIM sentence:  Whereas Popbitch is clear in its ambition to entertain and understands itself to poke fun and comment on the lighter side of celebrity culture, Guido Fawkes, though ostensibly and in many respects similar, is different in nature

CLAIM sentence:  Popbitch, by contrast, has , subscribers, whilst Holy Moly, which also covers celebrity news and gossip, serves 

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the stand-alone blogs and sites described above, many established news providers also use blogs for example the Guardian has been running a live blog on the Leveson Inquiry since the first of the Inquiry seminars either for specific events or issues, or just by way of communicating with readers in a different manner

CLAIM sentence:  At the other end of the spectrum, many individuals run blogs on matters which are of interest to them, some of which will, from time to time, cover issues of news or current affairs and some which may well break stories if the people writing them are well placed to do so

CLAIM sentence:  These vastly different sites are all offered to the public in the same way; they all have the same theoretical reach to the entire internet-connected population at the touch of a button (particularly when facilitated by search engines)

CLAIM sentence:  They are also, with the regulatory exceptions set out above, entirely unregulated, though subject to civil and criminal law in appropriate jurisdictions

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is noteworthy that although the blogs cited here are read by very large numbers of people, it should not detract from the fact that most blogs are read by very few people

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, most blogs are rarely read as news or factual, but as opinion and must be considered as such

CLAIM sentence:  She said that she believed that the public had a right to know certain facts about certain celebrities, particularly given the ability of some to shape and influence peoples lives

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright argued that it is only right that publishers should bring material to the attention of the public if it brings to light what she described as the gap between peoples private life and public life

CLAIM sentence:  This she argues is not only very much in the public interest but is a reflection of everyday concerns that individuals may have, as well as the reality of celebrities and others putting potential personal or private information into the public domain through Facebook and other social media, that might sit uneasily or indeed at odds with their public persona

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright also explained that whilst Popbitch may not have formal processes for establishing whether content might be in the public interest or a breach of privacy, the company does consult with and take advice from media lawyers, who have at times provided extracts from the Editors Code of Conduct which they perceive might be useful for Popbitch to consider

CLAIM sentence:  Much as Popbitch understand itself to provide information to the public that it determines to be in the public interest, Guido Fawkes also prides itself on its ability to deliver stories it understands to be in the public interest, that might otherwise remain unknown

CLAIM sentence:  He referred in evidence to material made available by his blog which a court had ordered should be removed from the internet

CLAIM sentence:  This is explored in more detail below

CLAIM sentence:  Guido Fawkes also receives material that journalists want to push further and establish whether the story in question has legs

CLAIM sentence:  Much as the Guido Fawkes site is used as a proxy by some newspapers and a means of running stories that might lead to a newspaper being challenged, Ms Wright said that Popbitch is also occasionally used by journalists from print newspapers in this manner

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Wright made clear that is a practice that she generally seeks to avoid

CLAIM sentence:  She noted that such an approach has not happened for some time

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright was also keen to emphasise that she would only publish such information if it were in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  This, she said, has not yet happened

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry also heard evidence from the Carla Buzasi, Editor in Chief of the Huffington Post UK

CLAIM sentence:  In contrast to either Popbitch or Guido Fawkes, the Huffington Post UK is not a blog built around the knowledge and gossip of a given area, it is an online newspaper employing trained journalists and abiding by journalistic standards as set out in the Editors Code of Practice, as well as participating in the system of self-regulation for the press through the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The Huffington Post UK also functions as a news aggregator and links to news content hosted on other websites, as well as hosting blogs for the discussion and dissemination of opinion

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Buzasi acknowledged that there may be a limited number of circumstances in which single sourcing was acceptable, but it was not the rule

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Buzasi suggested that membership of the PCC was a natural next step for the Huffington Post UK as it had long abided by the terms of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, she said in response to questions from the Inquiry that she believed Popbitchs own system of internal or personal regulation was more effective and better suited to the needs of the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  With regard to the oversight and regulation of content published by third parties, views of the Huffington Post UK to hosted and other user generated content on its site are broadly typical of other hosting sites

CLAIM sentence:  The Huffington Post UK does not pre-moderate or edit that content

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, Ms Buzasi has said that: We want to have their personalities shine through on their blogs but there is a framework to ensure that were or our bloggers are complying with the law

CLAIM sentence:  Mu Buzasi said that a small number of comments were routed through a filter which may pick up certain word combinations or profanities

CLAIM sentence:  These were then directed to a moderator for review

CLAIM sentence:  Comment that was flagged by users was also directed to a moderator for review

CLAIM sentence:  She regards this freedom from regulation as a necessary condition for the nurture of creative talent and encouragement of new media enterprises, particularly if there are substantive costs associated with that system

CLAIM sentence:  Google is by some margin the largest publisher of third party content to have given evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Specifically, Google hosts user generated content through its Blogger

CLAIM sentence:  Many blogs sites now run on a commercial basis

CLAIM sentence:  Although the approach to what appears on the website or blog will vary from site to site, the technical costs associated with running a site of this sort are relatively low, and barriers to entry to the market for both new players, be they individuals or much larger firms, are similarly low

CLAIM sentence:  Social networking sites 

CLAIM sentence:  Most social network services are web-based, providing means for users to interact over the Internet, potentially through e-mail and instant messaging

CLAIM sentence:  Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ are all social network sites

CLAIM sentence:  Ten years ago there were no social networks; now the largest social networking site, Facebook, has over m users worldwide (although Facebook has recently suggested that as many of m of these accounts may be either dormant, fake or used for questionable purposes)

CLAIM sentence:  The rise of Twitter has been similarly rapid

CLAIM sentence:  Founded in , it now counts over  million active users each month, sending a billion tweets every four days

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps most astonishingly (and for this Inquiry of concern to those who may be the subject either of Tweets that breach privacy or indeed the criminal or civil law), is the speed with which a message might be propagated

CLAIM sentence:  Colin Crowell, Head of Global public Policy for Twitter Inc, noted that during the  Superbowl, Twitter processed , tweets per second

CLAIM sentence:  Increasingly newspapers themselves not only use the pages of social networking sites to disseminate news, but also provide platform friendly applications, to enable the application to be accessed through the specific social media

CLAIM sentence:  of the phenomenon of Fry-bombing), it should not detract from the fact that most tweets are read by very few people

CLAIM sentence:  Although social networking sites are not obviously in competition with newspapers for audience, revenue or advertising, they may be used to publish information that would not be able to be published by a newspaper in conformity with the standards set by self-regulation

CLAIM sentence:  In a practical, though not a legal, sense they might also be used to publish information that a court has ruled should not be published with little likelihood of the publisher being identified and held to account

CLAIM sentence:  It is in this regard that Twitter has been the focus of some interest to the Inquiry because of the role played by users in identifying individuals who had been the subject of privacy injunctions

CLAIM sentence:  Twitter allows members to operate anonymously, or under a pseudonym, and it is also possible that the company itself may not know the real identity of any member

CLAIM sentence:  Most social networking sites and publishers of user generated content operate acceptable use policies (AUPs) which set down guidelines for user behaviour on those sites and cover issues such as posting of offensive content and bullying

CLAIM sentence:  Where a policy is breached, material is removed and in some cases the users profile is deleted

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, the instant nature of social networking also differentiates it from more traditional media

CLAIM sentence:  Rebuttals and denials of allegations can take place instantly, helping if not to kill a story at least to provide the subject of the story with a voice and make users aware that the veracity of the allegation or story may be in doubt

CLAIM sentence:  Consideration of the law The major websites and providers of internet services, be they social networking sites or providers of other services or functionality, tend to operate under US law if that is where the company is based

CLAIM sentence:  This can and does lead to conflicts of law, for example, where issues such as consideration of privacy and other related matters conflict with rights under the First Amendment of the American Constitution

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard much evidence in this regard

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright said that as Popbitch is published in the UK it abides by general law

CLAIM sentence:  This includes making efforts to ensure that content is not defamatory

CLAIM sentence:  Asked by Counsel to the Inquiry whether she considered the privacy of individuals about whom she writes, Ms Wright said: In era where injunctions have been such a much-talked about thing, that obviously has to be a consideration

CLAIM sentence:  I think if I could put it this way, Popbitch is an entertainment product, therefore we are trying to do no more than poke fun in the world of celebrity

CLAIM sentence:  We get a lot of stories in [sic] which we dont print, which are things like somebodys gone to rehab, somebody has cancer, or its about their children

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright also said that consideration of privacy issues was more important to Popbitch than it once was

CLAIM sentence:  In evidence she referred to the example of Victoria Beckhams pregnancy, noting that at the time the pregnancy was widely discussed, and that although Popbitch were the first publishers to write about the story, the fact of that pregnancy was no secret

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Wright has said further: I would be I think since then much more careful about making sure that a pregnancy was beyond twelve weeks before in this case, this was that as well, but I would be very careful about doing that

CLAIM sentence:  He gave the specific example of a memorandum prepared by Merrill Lynch setting out concerns at the future prospects of Northern Rock which suggested that the eventual cost to the taxpayer might be as much as bn

CLAIM sentence:  More typical were those of the Huffington Post UK, which have already been partly addressed

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Buzasi was clear that the Huffington Post UK abides by UK law

CLAIM sentence:  Under the terms of use, users of the Huffington Post UK comment boards and blogs must undertake not to post anything that might be illegal

CLAIM sentence:  Users must also provide personal details, which means that legal orders or proceedings can be enforced should either legal action be brought or an injunction be imposed

CLAIM sentence:  However, she also explained that the Huffington Post UK was not able to review and pre-moderate potentially libellous or defamatory comment, a theme that was taken up by other witnesses to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Buzasi suggested that the inability of the Huffington Post UK to make adjudications in such matters is, to some extents, mitigated by provisions made for the correction of inaccurate or potentially actionable material through the prominent provision of send a correction button; the site also operates what Ms Buzasi has referred to as a robust notice and take down process

CLAIM sentence:  In this respect, the position of Twitter is markedly similar to that of both Google and Microsoft in relation to user-generated content

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Keller has made clear that both the volume and nature of the content make such decision making practically impossible

CLAIM sentence:  She told the Inquiry that such filtering is also technically impossible and would also run the risk of legal challenge if content that had been posted entirely legally were removed inadvertently as a consequence of such filtering

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Keller also explained the number of routes through which an individual might seek to remove material made available through Google services

CLAIM sentence:  It is notable, and indeed unfortunate although given the technological constraints understandable that in each example the burden of effort lies with the injured party

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Keller also said that this particular approach is in the view of Google the most effective means of getting content removed

CLAIM sentence:  Google also provides a remove content from Google service, which users may use to alert staff to potentially illegal content which will be taken down if it is understood not to comply with UK law

CLAIM sentence:  Google has adopted a similar, expedited approach in relation to content that is in breach of copyright

CLAIM sentence:  enforcement 

CLAIM sentence:  Despite the efforts made to comply with national law, it is clear that the enforcement of law and regulation online is problematic

CLAIM sentence:  Although the law with regard to online content is clear, and UK hosted content is by and large compliant, the ability of the UK to exercise legal jurisdiction over content on Internet services is extremely limited and dependent on many things (explored below) which are rarely aligned

CLAIM sentence:  They are, however, understandably unwilling to make decisions on whether content may or may not be illegal or to take decisions where there are grey areas in law

CLAIM sentence:  This has been particularly apparent in cases of alleged defamation, where ISPs and content providers have historically been unwilling to remove content without a court decision

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst the position of the ISPs and content providers may be understandable issues clearly arise as to their ability to decide on the veracity of an allegation in some cases considerable damage may have been done to the subject of those allegations before a judgment has been reached and the defamatory content consequently removed

CLAIM sentence:  In practice, this means that for Twitter to remove a defamatory tweet that was re-tweeted, a court order would be needed in relation to every relevant tweet by every individual unique user who repeated that defamatory content

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Keller acknowledged that while such material would be removed from a UK search, it might still be found through Google

CLAIM sentence: com if the material in question was not in breach of American law

CLAIM sentence:  This means in practice that, in order to have material removed from searches in multiple jurisdictions, a legal application would have to be made in each relevant jurisdiction

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Keller said in this respect that she hopes: this would not be a difficult thing to do

CLAIM sentence:  Both examples are also in counterpoint to the number of instances where UK legislation and decisions by UK courts are simply ignored, as they are unenforceable

CLAIM sentence:  Content providers headquartered in the United States will also strenuously defend rights to free speech under American law and indeed may themselves be at risk of prosecution if they remove allegedly defamatory or potentially illegal content ahead of a court decision

CLAIM sentence:  This position is not without legal underpinning under European Law

CLAIM sentence:  Under Article  of the European eCommerce Directive which sets out the regulatory framework for trade through the Internet, ISPs are not legally responsible for the content they carry over their pipes

CLAIM sentence:  This defence is known as mere conduit

CLAIM sentence:  Its important to make the distinction between in the system that youve outlined, its important to make the decision between someone who provides a hosting platform for other people to create and post content, and a publisher

CLAIM sentence: com or other products that are attempt to form a community around the product, YouTube, et cetera, they dont make us a publisher; we remain a hosting platform

CLAIM sentence:  So I think whatever system that you devise, its important to retain that distinction, because not only is there already a very clear set of regulations around those principles placing responsibilities on us, but it retains a very essential balance online, which is: where does that responsibility lie? We have our responsibilities, which we fulfil; the person that produces and uploads that content has his or her responsibilities as well

CLAIM sentence:  Their actions and conduct are covered elsewhere in this Report as appropriate, so I will restrict myself to a very few comments in this regard

CLAIM sentence:  Based on figures provided by the British Press Photographers Association (BPPA), it is estimated that there are around  press photographers in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  Those who operate on a freelance basis are not subject to any regulation beyond the law, as it applies to everyone

CLAIM sentence:  Much of the work undertaken by press photographers involves arranged photo shoots of one sort or another

CLAIM sentence:  However, press photographers obviously do also work by waiting for potential subjects and hoping to get pictures of them

CLAIM sentence:  This inevitably gives rise to the risk that photographs will be taken in situations where the subject might prefer not to be photographed and, as is made clear elsewhere in this report, may even be subject to harassment or distress

CLAIM sentence:  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in an accident that occurred while the car in which she was travelling was being pursued at high speed by a number of press photographers in  brought the role and behaviour of press photographers very much to public notice

CLAIM sentence:  A picture that might be turned down by a UK editor as not being consistent with the Code might well be accepted by non-UK newspapers, broadcasters or websites

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom defines plurality with reference to the desired outcome of a plural market: (a) ensuring there is a diversity of viewpoints available and consumed across and within media enterprises; (b) preventing any one media owner or voice having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda

CLAIM sentence:  (emphasis added)

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Submission-by-Ofcom-Measuring- Media-Plurality

CLAIM sentence: pdf  \xcfreedom of individual expression may be served to some extent by a free press in that such a press provides a vehicle for the expression of opinion in leader and comment columns

CLAIM sentence:  Such free expression can contribute to informed citizens through its role in the cut and thrust of ideas

CLAIM sentence:  However clearly there are only a limited number whose ideas are expressed in this way, and even with letters pages, and invited contributions from politicians and the like, the number able to express themselves is very small

CLAIM sentence:  and later: This argument could be taken further and it could be said that the public interest in freedom of expression can even be adversely affected by a free press, if certain other conditions hold such that some voices get much more prominence than others

CLAIM sentence:  So the public interest in freedom of self-expression, or freedom of opinion, is served by a free press, but only to some extent, and only if the structure of the press allows for sufficient diversity

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is also necessary to say what the scope of media plurality should be

CLAIM sentence:  There are arguments for broadening the scope, which are considered later in this Report

CLAIM sentence:  Historically, regulators have not really looked beyond news and current affairs when considering plurality

CLAIM sentence:  The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) argues that this is true up to a point, but it is difficult to regulate the coverage and prominence of stories

CLAIM sentence:  influencing the agenda by the extent to which particular stories are covered or not

CLAIM sentence:  One of the key aims of competition law is to ensure that no company has such a position of power within a market that it can abuse that power, for example to force competitors out of the market to the detriment of consumers

CLAIM sentence:  Competition law is designed to reduce concentration of market power and, therefore, will generally produce outcomes which support plurality

CLAIM sentence:  However, competition rules are also designed to prevent abuse of market power; it is possible that an owner could have a dominant position which he did not abuse in competition terms (and which will therefore be allowed under the competition regime) but which was deemed undesirable in relation to plurality

CLAIM sentence:  It is also likely that competition rules are less able to prevent unacceptable levels of cross-media ownership where each market may be seen as distinct for competition purposes

CLAIM sentence:  This was the position originally taken by the Government in relation to media mergers when the  Communications Bill was published

CLAIM sentence:  The result was that the Communications Act  includes provisions to allow the Secretary of State to take public interests considerations relating to plurality into account in proposed media mergers

CLAIM sentence:  Moreover, it is difficult to regulate for different points of view, so ownership restrictions act as an effective proxy for plurality

CLAIM sentence:  As more and more services become available on different platforms, concerns over ownership have diminished to some extent and greater liberalisation has been permitted

CLAIM sentence:  However, we must also allow the media to continue to perform its vital role in democratic society, as a forum for public debate and opinion

CLAIM sentence:  For the purposes of the Report I merely summarise the key points

CLAIM sentence:  It also introduced an upper limit on any person owning more than two Regional Channel  licences

CLAIM sentence:  In the Governments view, this competition served to underpin the impartiality of both services, guaranteeing plurality for viewers

CLAIM sentence:  This may well have been because these services were not subject to the same spectrum constraints as analogue services

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  also placed different ownership restrictions on DBS and non- DBS satellite services

CLAIM sentence:  This made ownership of one or more such channels less of a significant issue in plurality terms

CLAIM sentence:  In addition there was a calculation based on coverage area designed to ensure a minimum of seven owners across the UK

CLAIM sentence:  Non-EEA companies could hold certain licences including for cable and satellite services

CLAIM sentence:  In  the Government consulted on removing these restrictions and the matter was the subject of extensive debate

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom makes any recommendations for further reform to the Secretary of State, who can amend or remove rules by secondary legislation

CLAIM sentence:  The first review in  recommended no change

CLAIM sentence:  pdf  Chapter  | Plurality C\xcthe matter further, the Secretary of State concluded that the remaining rule should also be removed; this was given effect by the Media Ownership (Radio and Cross Media) Order 

CLAIM sentence:  The process by which the media plurality public interest test was inserted into the Communications Bill, and the rationale behind it, is also fully outlined later in the Report

CLAIM sentence:  These provisions mean that the Secretary of State can ask Ofcom and, if necessary, the Competition Commission to investigate any merger which could have a damaging effect on plurality, diversity or standards

CLAIM sentence:  The Government produced further guidance on how the public interest test would be operated in practice

CLAIM sentence:  The request to Ofcom is triggered by an intervention notice issued by the Secretary of State which specifies a media public interest consideration

CLAIM sentence:  A media public interest consideration is any consideration which, at the time of the giving of the European intervention notice concerned, is specified in s(A) to (C) of the Enterprise Act  or, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is concerned with broadcasting or newspapers and ought to be specified in s of the Act (ie would need to be finalised by statutory instrument)

CLAIM sentence:  The currently recognised media public interest considerations are: (a) s(A): the need for accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion in newspapers;  pp-, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  of the guidance issued by the DTI identifies the following as relevant to this question: previous compliance with Ofcom standards, the behaviour of the media owners other broadcasting enterprises, behaviour in other jurisdictions and compliance with other standards (including under self-regulatory regimes)

CLAIM sentence:  Where there has been an intervention notice, Ofcom is required to report to the Secretary of State on whether, having regard only to the public interest consideration specified in the intervention notice, it is or may be the case that the merger may be expected to operate against the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  It is then for the Secretary of State to determine whether or not the merger should be referred to the Competition Commission for further review and, if necessary, consideration of remedies

CLAIM sentence:  There have only been two occasions on which the Secretary of State has issued an intervention notice in relation to a media merger

CLAIM sentence:  On both occasions, the public interest consideration was: the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience

CLAIM sentence: % stake in ITV, was a UK merger

CLAIM sentence:  The Secretary of State referred the case to the Competition Commission

CLAIM sentence:  The Competition Commission considered that the transaction raised competition issues, but not plurality issues, and on its recommendation the Secretary of State required BSkyB to sell shares so as to reduce its holding to below 

CLAIM sentence:  The decision was appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal and to the Court of Appeal; the Court of Appeal upheld the Competition Commissions decision

CLAIM sentence:  DCMS has also very helpfully provided a history of the newspaper ownership regime

CLAIM sentence:  I draw heavily on it and gratefully acknowledge the work that was put into it

CLAIM sentence:  This was first introduced by then Monopolies and Mergers Act , following the Report of the Royal Commission on the Press in  (the Shawcross report)

CLAIM sentence:  Shawcross concluded that control of the press was a matter of particular public sensitivity and that the increasing concentration of newspaper ownership in too few hands could stifle the expression of opinion and argument and distort the presentation of news

CLAIM sentence:  The FTA required the Competition Commission (CC) to look at whether the transfer in question might be expected to operate against the public interest, taking into account all matters which appeared in the circumstances to be relevant

CLAIM sentence:  The Secretary of State was required to refer newspaper applications to the CC for a detailed report before deciding whether or not to consent to the transfer

CLAIM sentence:  Where a takeover or merger does not meet the jurisdictional criteria it is still possible for the Secretary of State to intervene under the special public interest regime; this applies in any case where the newspaper to be acquired has a % share of a market in a substantial part of the United Kingdom

CLAIM sentence:  The Secretary of State retains the power to refer those cases that involve the public interest in plurality for wider investigation by the CC

CLAIM sentence:  The plurality public interest considerations are set out in s (A) and (B) of the Enterprise Act  and cover: (a) (b) (c) accurate presentation of the news in newspapers; free expression of opinion in newspapers; and to the extent reasonable and practicable, a sufficient plurality of views in newspapers, in each market for newspapers in the UK or a part of the UK

CLAIM sentence:  Where there has been a reference to the CC, it will make recommendations as to any remedies it deems appropriate to meet competition or plurality concerns

CLAIM sentence:  However, the Secretary of State may seek the advice of Ofcom on the CCs recommendations on the plurality aspects of the transfer

CLAIM sentence:  He can disregard the competition authorities proposed solutions to competition problems, but only where the plurality issues justify this course of action: the Secretary of State will decide overall on the basis of a public interest test that will take account of both plurality and competition

CLAIM sentence:  The conclusions of this review were published in the final Digital Britain report

CLAIM sentence:  The OFT subsequently revised their Jurisdictional and Procedural Merger Guidance accordingly

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom considered that a merger could provide the opportunity to rationalise costs, maintain quality and investment, and provide a sounder commercial base from which to address long-term structural change, for example by expanding the availability of online and other digital local services

CLAIM sentence:  It also said that these potential benefits needed to be weighed against any potential customer harm resulting from reduced competition identified in the OFTs overall assessment

CLAIM sentence:  Despite this, on  October , the OFT referred the proposed merger to the Competition Commission, and the CC cancelled its inquiry after KMG announced it was abandoning the proposed acquisition as a result of the referral and some of the titles concerned were closed

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction In order to understand the present position in relation to press regulation, it is necessary to examine what has happened in the past

CLAIM sentence:  This chapter of the Report examines the content and context of the three Royal Commissions into the British Press undertaken since the Second World War, the Younger Report into Privacy of , and the two reports of Sir David Calcutt QC into privacy and the press published in  and 

CLAIM sentence:  Taken together, these form the formal public policy response to concerns with the press, press standards and the behaviour of journalists and others acting on behalf of newspapers and their employees, in the post-war period

CLAIM sentence:  It can be argued that the findings of the three Royal Commissions as well as the reports of Sir David Calcutt not only help to elucidate a pattern of press behaviour that remains pertinent to the work of this Inquiry, but also set out a series of attempts to find a solution to problems that remain broadly unchanged and unaddressed

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard, the Media Standards Trust has said in its submission to the Inquiry: The conclusion that self-regulation on its own, without any greater independence or enhanced powers, does not provide adequate protection for the public or for journalists - is based in large part on an historical analysis of the continued failure of the various voluntary self-regulatory bodies that have existed since the first Royal Commission on the Press published its report in 

CLAIM sentence:  Some context As has been emphasised in this Report on more than one occasion, the British press has a long held reputation for the vitality and quality of its journalism as well as the diversity of voices with which it speaks

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly, it has been with something approaching envy that overseas commentators examining the British press both historically and today have been impressed by both its freedoms and the breadth and scope of its journalism

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard, it is worth highlighting the very large number of occasions that the Inquiry has been told with real pride by commentators, journalists, proprietors and politicians about the achievements of the British press and the valuable role it plays in the public life of the nation

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, it has been made very clear during the course of this Inquiry that journalism of the highest quality is not restricted only to a certain section of the press but is to be found across its many distinct and different  p, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  parts: not only in the broadsheets but also in the mid-market titles and the tabloids along with the regional and local press, both in print and now also in their online editions

CLAIM sentence:  Before dealing with the analysis of historical responses to the culture and practices of the press, it is worth restating that the press does not exist in a vacuum

CLAIM sentence:  It is subject to other forces

CLAIM sentence:  Technological and societal changes have increased the pressures on what is and has historically been an intensely competitive market

CLAIM sentence:  Overall, these forces have had an important role in shaping the culture, practices and ethics of the press over decades

CLAIM sentence:  Concerns as to the behaviour and practices of the press have been articulated by both private individuals and Governments throughout the twentieth century, and (in one form or another) very much earlier

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, some of the practices and concerns that gave rise to the  Royal Commission into the Press, and in particular those in relation to the breach of privacy of individuals, have been effectively repeated before this Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, the historical review carried out in this chapter demonstrates a number of common themes; in particular, it reveals not merely consistent and similar complaints over the preceding decades, but also consistent and similar proposed solutions

CLAIM sentence:  Shortly after the election of the Labour Government in May , the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) passed a resolution which called for the new administration to establish an independent Commission to examine, among other things, structures of ownership and control of British newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  The NUJ resolution also gave voice to other concerns and called for a Commission to investigate: 

CLAIM sentence: with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recommendations thereon

CLAIM sentence:  The resolution led to the tabling of a motion in the House of Commons that repeated its central concerns

CLAIM sentence:  Advanced by members of Parliament who had either worked as journalists or were still employed as such, the motion also made an explicit connection between the growing concentration in newspaper ownership by a small number of proprietors as well as the substantial increases in the profitability of some newspapers since the conclusion  Moore, M, The Origins of Modern Spin: Democratic government and the media in Britain, -, p  Part D | StandardsD\xc

CLAIM sentence:  of hostilities, and a supposed decline in the quality of British journalism

CLAIM sentence:  The motion was passed by MPs on the  October 

CLAIM sentence:  It read: That, having regard to the increasing public concern at the growth of monopolistic tendencies in the control of the Press and with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news this House considers that a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire into the finance, control, management and ownership of the Press

CLAIM sentence:  The reversion to a peacetime modus operandi also heralded the return, after the quiescence of the war years, of a number of sharper journalistic practices increasingly unpalatable to the public at large

CLAIM sentence:  These were manifest to differing degrees in accusations of inaccuracy and political bias on the one hand and alarm at the intrusion of journalists into the private lives of individuals on the other

CLAIM sentence:  However, public indignation at such behaviour was not new; the culture and practices of some parts of the press had been noted as a matter of concern by the immediate pre-war Government-appointed Political and Economic Planning (PEP) group which, in , had formulated the first significant proposal for formal self-regulation of the press

CLAIM sentence:  This, the report suggested, should consider and mediate complaints made by members of the public about the press

CLAIM sentence:  The outbreak of war drew an end to any further work to achieve this end

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission was granted a broad remit by the Government of Clement Atlee and was charged with seeking answers to a number of questions that went further than the concerns that have been outlined above

CLAIM sentence:  The Government asked that the Commission investigate:,  Whether the degree of concentration of ownership of newspapers, periodicals, and news agencies at present exists; Whether there is a tendency towards further concentration; Whether such concentration as exists is on balance disadvantageous to the free expression of opinion or the accurate presentation of news; Whether any other factors in the control, management or ownership of the Press or of the news agencies, or any external influences operating on those concerned in control, management or ownership, militate against this freedom and accuracy; and  ibid, p  Great Britain, Royal Commission on the Press -: Report, p  OMalley, T and C Soley, Regulating the Press, pp-  Political and Economic Planning, Report on the British Press  whereas [w]e have deemed it expedient that a Commission should forthwith issue with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recommendations thereon, ibid, piii  ibid, pp-  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xc How this freedom and accuracy may best be promoted

CLAIM sentence:  It found that there had been a progressive decline in the calibre of editors and in the quality of British journalism which, it argued, if not addressed would undermine not only the freedom of the press itself, but also the welfare of the country at large

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission was unambiguous in its consideration of statutory controls which, it argued, would unacceptably restrict the freedoms of the press

CLAIM sentence:  It said that it was necessary: 

CLAIM sentence:  The Royal Commission hoped that the proposed General Press Council would function both as a guarantor of the freedom and prestige of the Press, by representing the interests of the newspaper industry through a single, unified voice as well as a brake on poor and unethical journalistic practices

CLAIM sentence:  In so doing the Royal Commission made a fundamental statement on the nature of the relationship between the state of the press and the health of the nation as a whole, suggesting a correlation between the ownership structures of the newspaper industry and the incidence of inaccurate reporting and poor journalism

CLAIM sentence:  Significantly too, the Royal Commissions report recognised that, as a consequence of technological and commercial changes, the ability of newspapers to disseminate to the public a mass of information on subjects as complicated as they are important had increased, but there had been no commensurate increase in journalism fitting or appropriate to such purpose

CLAIM sentence:  The Report of the Royal Commission made a number of recommendations, some of which added important detail to the central proposal of the formation of this General Council

CLAIM sentence:  The Commissions Report also set out what Sir William David Ross and his fellow commissioners regarded as the necessary and non-negotiable elements of an effective regulatory regime for the British press

CLAIM sentence:  It was intended by the Commission that the Press Council should have sufficient powers to maintain press standards and where appropriate to impose sanctions for poor conduct: It should have the right to consider any complaints which it may receive about the conduct of the Press or of any persons towards the Press, to deal with these complaints in whatever manner may seem to it practicable and appropriate, and to include in an annual report a statement of any action taken

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear from the recommendations made by the Royal Commission that it intended that the Press Council should have a broad remit, encompassing a number of potentially problematic and conflicting functions; this would include being a champion of press freedom as well as a defender of the rights of members of the public who might have been mistreated by the  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  ibid, p  Great Britain () Op cit, p  Part D | StandardsD\xcpress

CLAIM sentence:  In addition the Royal Commission proposed that the General Council of the Press should have appropriate powers to monitor and rule on the terms and conditions of the employment of journalists and other newspaper workers, whilst also promoting the interests of consumers and conducting research into the long-term social and economic impacts of the print industry

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission was clear; its proposals were not intended to safeguard its own liberty but to save the press from itself

CLAIM sentence:  Although Parliament unconditionally accepted the recommendations of the Commission, the industry response to them was slow and much wrangling and negotiation followed

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, it has been convincingly argued by some commentators that such progress was only made as a consequence of the real threat of statutory regulation

CLAIM sentence:  The initial industry response of the press to the Report of the Royal Commission found little favour with the then Government

CLAIM sentence:  The NUJ also declared the newspaper industrys proposals to be unacceptable to the Union and its members

CLAIM sentence:  This Bill was intended to establish a Press Council in statute

CLAIM sentence:  When it was eventually established in , the General Council of the Press, as had been fashioned by the industry and endorsed by the Conservative Government, was substantially different from the proposals that had been recommended by the Royal Commission

CLAIM sentence:  In many respects, the changes which had been made to the structures and functions of the nascent Press Council were to the benefit of the industry and not to those who complained of having been the victims of press mistreatment

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the recommendation that the Press Council be able to investigate and make findings on complaints brought by members of the public was changed so that, in most circumstances, only complaints by persons affected by stories would be accepted; third party complaints would be entertained on a discretionary basis and exceptionally

CLAIM sentence:  Other recommendations relating to the promotion of standards and the employment conditions of journalists and other newspaper employees were also omitted from the final proposals brought forward by the industry

CLAIM sentence:  Committee\tinto\tprivacy\t The General Council of the Press was neither the body nor the panacea that the Royal Commission had intended

CLAIM sentence:  From the outset it was the subject of criticism, particularly from those who thought themselves the victims of press mistreatment

CLAIM sentence:  It was seen as self-serving and concerned more with defending the interests of journalists and newspaper editors than in addressing the many issues identified by the first Royal Commission on the press

CLAIM sentence:  In  a second Royal Commission was established: 

CLAIM sentence: to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom

CLAIM sentence:  He brought a formidable intellect to the task as well as a reputation for gravitas and forensic analysis achieved as Chief UK Counsel for the Prosecution in the post-war Nuremberg trials

CLAIM sentence:  The establishment of a second Royal Commission on the press was prompted in part by the closure of a number of national and provincial newspapers which had led to a further, and to some, worrying concentration in the ownership of newspaper titles

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission was not primarily concerned with the performance of the press or with questions of ethical behaviour, and indeed its terms of reference made no express reference to either of these matters

CLAIM sentence:  But its very establishment reflected political and public concern at the steady build up of complaint, as well as public disapproval, at press behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Some contemporary commentators sought to explain this further decline in standards through the prism of increased competition for circulation

CLAIM sentence:  Others called into question the effectiveness of the overall system of self-regulation through the General Council of the Press, decrying its inability to put an end to press intrusion into the private lives of individuals

CLAIM sentence:   Great Britain, Royal Commission on the Press -: Report, p  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  Great Britain, Royal Commission on the Press -: Report, p  Part D | StandardsD\xc

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission levelled substantial criticism at the General Council of the Press for, in particular, its failure to implement many of the recommendations made by the first Royal Commission on the press

CLAIM sentence:  The Shawcross Commission clearly identified those issues that it deemed had led to a decline in press standards, and it called for an improvement in the performance of the General Council of the Press

CLAIM sentence:  However, the solutions it proposed were little different from those articulated by the first Royal Commission in 

CLAIM sentence:  It recommended that the industry should be given two years to bring forward, develop and implement appropriate plans but, should these not be forthcoming, recommended that the Government should introduce the legislation necessary to establish a Press Council in statute, with powers equivalent to those recommended originally by the first Royal Commission in 

CLAIM sentence:  The General Council of the Press was reformed as the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  For the first time it included lay representation on its board

CLAIM sentence:  The newly formed Press Council also made amendments to its constitution to reflect the wider recommendations made by the Commission

CLAIM sentence:  Clauses that were no longer regarded as relevant to its role and remit were removed and, in particular, a new clause was introduced in relation to the consideration of complaints about the press

CLAIM sentence:  The reformed Press Council also took a more proactive approach to the consideration of some of the most significant challenges facing the press and published guidance on contempt of court, privacy and defamation

CLAIM sentence:  These reforms, however, were not universally well-received

CLAIM sentence:  Questions were asked almost immediately about the ability of the Press Council to regulate the actions and conduct of newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  These had altered little over time, and the press continued to push at the boundaries of what was considered acceptable journalism

CLAIM sentence:  Coverage of the Profumo scandal and, in particular, the Suns exclusive interview with Christine Keeler, as well as the vilification of the child-killer Mary Bell, by turns titivated, entranced and horrified the public

CLAIM sentence:  Further, allegations of payments for stories relating to the Profumo affair, as well as to witnesses in the case of the Moors Murders, undermined confidence in the efficacy of the Press Council as the regulatory body for the press

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps unsurprisingly, by the end of the decade there were calls for a further Royal Commission on the press as well as an inquiry into the workings  ibid, p  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  ibid, pp-  ibid, pp-  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xcof the Press Council which had struggled to be seen as anything more than a champion of the press [rather] than as a watchdog for the public

CLAIM sentence:  The introduction of a Private Members Bill on privacy forced the hand of the Wilson Government, and in  a new Committee looking, once again, at the behaviour of the press was constituted

CLAIM sentence:  Published in July , the report of the Younger Committee on privacy was highly critical of the Press Council and its seeming inability to command the confidence of the British public

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee suggested a causal link between the level of lay representation on the Press Council and the overall credibility of that organisation in the public mind

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission duly recommended that the Press Council increase the representation of lay members; it also recommended that steps be taken to ensure the independence of lay appointments because, in its view, the process of appointment was both opaque and too readily open to influence from the industry

CLAIM sentence:  Of the recommendations made by the Younger Committee, perhaps the most significant related to the publication of Press Council adjudications by newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  The Younger Committee suggested that where an adverse adjudication had been issued by the Council, it should be given similar prominence to that given to the original article

CLAIM sentence:  The Younger Committee also recommended that the Council make efforts to codify its adjudications on privacy and build up a body of case law understood by the industry

CLAIM sentence:  It is perhaps indicative of the prevailing mood that the Committee did not unanimously agree the recommendations made in the final report

CLAIM sentence:  However, a minority of the commissioners who worked together with Sir Kenneth, did not believe the recommendations to be sufficiently far-reaching, and a minority report was published which recommended among other things a general law of privacy to provide individuals with proper protection from unjustified press intrusion

CLAIM sentence:  The reforms of the Press Council, which were finally implemented in July , did not encompass the most significant of the recommendations made in the Younger Report

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, recommendations on the prominence of adjudications and the codification of rulings had been dropped

CLAIM sentence:  Lay membership on the Press Council was increased by four to ten, which was exactly half the number of industry representatives

CLAIM sentence:  Begrudgingly accepting the Committees recommendation, the Chairman of the Press Council, Lord Pearce, noted that the Younger Report had provided no evidence to support the conclusions it made linking public confidence in the Press Council to the proportion of lay representatives but, nonetheless,  Robertson, G People Against the Press: An Inquiry into the Press Council, p  Frost, C, Journalism Ethics and Regulation, p  Great Britain, The Report of the Committee on Privacy, p  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  Snoddy, R, Op cit, p  Part D | StandardsD\xcfurther minor changes were made to increase the number of lay representatives serving on the Complaints Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Following the publication of the Younger Report, public criticism of the Press Council, characterised by Lord Pearce as assaults on the principle of self-regulation, became more commonplace

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly, the tensions between the regulator, the regulated and the public were made more acute by the political and social tensions between the Government, the trade unions and the industry more broadly, and did little to address the failings, both perceived and actual, of the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, the performance of the Press Council was regarded by the Government of the day as so inadequate that, within a year of publication of Sir Kenneth Youngers report, not only was a third Royal Commission on the Press established, but it was given an express remit to examine in detail the responsibilities, constitution and functioning of the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  The Third Royal Commission on the Press was established on  March  under the Chairmanship of Professor Oliver (later Lord) MacGregor, then a leading academic in the field of socio-legal studies and medical sociology and, immediately before his appointment, a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford

CLAIM sentence:  The MacGregor Commission was constituted not only in the context of ongoing discussions on the recommendations of the Younger Report on privacy but also against a continuing backdrop of concern at the behaviour of journalists and the press more widely

CLAIM sentence:  Public and political frustration was also growing at the apparent inability of the Press Council to curb the worst excess of such behaviour or to provide sufficient redress to those who had been wronged by the press

CLAIM sentence:  The MacGregor Commission was granted a broad remit and was invited to: 

CLAIM sentence: inquire into the factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity and editorial standards of newspapers and periodicals and the public freedom of choice of newspapers and periodicals, nationally, regionally and locally

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission expressed concern that there was no real public or political consensus on the role of press in British society

CLAIM sentence:  It recognised that the press should not be subject to state control but it refused to advocate a press that was subject only to the unregulated forces of the market and the pursuit of profit

CLAIM sentence:  Although undecided on the most suitable form of regulation for the press, the Commission was unequivocal in its criticism of the Press Council both as a regulator of press standards and as able to provide appropriate means of redress

CLAIM sentence:  The Commissions proposals for reform of the Press Council included a reiteration of the dormant recommendations of the first and second Royal Commissions as to the prominence  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  ibid, p  Great Britain, Royal Commission on the Press: Final Report, p(i)  ibid, pp(i-ii)  ibid, p  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xcand location of adjudications

CLAIM sentence:  Lord MacGregors Commission, in line with the previous Royal Commissions and the Younger Commission, also proposed that the question of confidence in the Press Council should be addressed through an increase in the number of lay representatives and the appointment of a lay Chairman

CLAIM sentence:  It also recommended that the Press Council should seek to curb the worst excesses of the press through the development and implementation of a written code of conduct

CLAIM sentence:  The Commissions report noted: 

CLAIM sentence: it is unhappily certain that the Council has so far failed to persuade the knowledgeable public that it deals satisfactorily with complaints against newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  The MacGregor Commission also made recommendations intended to effect a fundamental shift in the treatment and handling by the Press Council of complaints made by members of the public

CLAIM sentence:  It proposed that the Press Council should not only act as mediator and arbitrator of complaints but should also actively seek, where appropriate, to secure the swift publication of adjudications, where necessary on the front page

CLAIM sentence:  The MacGregor Commission also entered new terrain, as its recommendations included: The creation of a Conciliator, drawn from the staff of the Council, to propose remedies between complainants and newspapers: The extension of the Councils doctrine of right of reply, and to uphold a newspapers making space available to those it has criticised inaccurately (although the Commission rejected the introduction of a legal right of reply on the principle that the press should not be subject to different laws than ordinary citizens); The power to investigate the conduct of the press without waiting for a formal complaint; to introduce the practice of undertaking wider reviews of publications and journalists involved in disputes; The amendment of the Councils existing position on accuracy and bias, so that inaccuracy should be prima facie evidence for upholding a complaint; The Chairmans role to be extended to chairmanship of the Appointments Commission; and That the Council should accept recommendations for lay appointments from any source

CLAIM sentence:  In line with the approach of the Second Royal Commission, the final report of the MacGregor Commission suggested that if the response of the industry and Press Council was insufficient to address ongoing concerns as to press conduct and restore confidence in the Press Council, then a statutory solution might need to be sought

CLAIM sentence:  That said, Professor MacGregor remained hopeful that such measures would not be necessary

CLAIM sentence:  The conclusion to its report set out its aspiration and belief that: 

CLAIM sentence: these recommendations will be accepted and acted on by the Press Council, and that it will fulfil the hopes that were held for it in 

CLAIM sentence:  In a yet further parallel to the Younger Review, the MacGregor Commission published a minority report, its adherents taking the line that more was needed to modify the culture, practices and ethics of the press

CLAIM sentence:  Much as the publication of the MacGregor Report in  had mirrored the publication of the Shawcross report in , there were many similarities between the reactions of the Press Council and the industry to the two sets of recommendations

CLAIM sentence:  The Press Council rejected the most significant recommendations of the MacGregor Commission, arguing that they amounted to an unnecessary restraint on the press and muzzled freedom of expression, despite widespread and very public calls for meaningful reform

CLAIM sentence:  In all, five out of twelve of the MacGregor Commissions recommendations for reform of the Press Council were explicitly rejected, including the recommendation for a written Code of Conduct, and a number of others were de facto ignored

CLAIM sentence: previous outcomes of ,  and  (when the recommendations of the first two Royal Commissions and the Younger Report were implemented)

CLAIM sentence:  Yet although the reaction of the industry was predictably obstructive, the reaction of the public was different

CLAIM sentence:  Whereas the newspaper industry had criticised the recommendations made by Professor MacGregor because of the restrictions they believed the proposals would, if implemented, have placed not only on freedom of speech but also on the ability of journalists to hold the rich and powerful to account, public criticism of the report focused on the perceived weakness of its proposals, particularly in relation to the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  In a curious twist of fate, contemporary commentators also suggested that there were unintended consequences to the publication of the MacGregor report, namely that the extent of the criticism of the Council in the report weakened it still further and did little to improve the long-term credibility of that body

CLAIM sentence: \t The\tfirst\treport\tof\tSir\tDavid\tCalcutt\tQC 

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear that neither the MacGregor Commission nor the limited and begrudging response of the industry to its recommendations did much to stem the increasingly growing sense that self-regulation of the press through the offices of the Press Council was not an effective means of limiting harmful press behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, they fostered a polarisation of the debate on the role of the press in British society and the most effective means of regulating what many believed to be the most harmful aspects of press behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, the period between the publication of the report of the third Royal Commission and the formation of the Press Complaints Committee in  (following the publication of the first of the reviews of the press by Sir David Calcutt) witnessed some of the most egregious examples of press  Great Britain (), Op cit, p  ibid, pp-  ibid, p: [The Council] rejected the Commissions suggestion that it should seek undertakings that newspapers would publish adjudications upholding complaints against them on their front page

CLAIM sentence:  The growing list of high-profile incidents involving harmful press behaviour tested public and Parliamentary support for the Press Council and led to a crescendo of criticism

CLAIM sentence:  The corollary to this was the continued erosion of public support for voluntary self-regulation

CLAIM sentence:  It should not be doubted that contemporaneous arguments about journalistic freedoms and the most effective means of regulating the British press were amplified through the wider travails and industrial disputes that afflicted the industry during this period

CLAIM sentence:  Back in , the Labour Party had published a report entitled The People and the Media which set out its thinking on the British media and communications markets

CLAIM sentence:  It proposed that a joint regulatory code should be developed for both broadcasting and the press, and that public confidence in the regulator should be fostered through greater transparency, regular public review of that body and a legally enforceable right of reply

CLAIM sentence:  The report also considered the state of the press market and, perhaps unsurprisingly for a document produced by a political party which was not always favourably characterised in press reporting, bemoaned a lack of accountability and bias in the press

CLAIM sentence:  More significantly, The People and the Media was also strongly critical of the existing system of self-regulation through the Press Council; whilst the Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan did little to change the system of self-regulation for the press, the report marked an fundamental shift in political support for the Press Council, which had previously benefited from the tacit support of both the Labour and the Conservative Parties

CLAIM sentence:  The Labour Party was certainly not alone in its criticism of the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  The Campaign for Press Freedom (which would later be re-constituted as the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom (CPF)) also advocated a complete overhaul of regulation of the press

CLAIM sentence:  The CPF also sought to lay the blame for the lack of real and meaningful reform at the door of the Press Council and the system of self-regulation itself

CLAIM sentence:  So concerned was the CPF at the perceived injustices of the existing system that it established its own Inquiry into the Press Council and matters relating to it

CLAIM sentence:  When it was finally published in , the CPF report (known as the Robertson Report on the Press Council after its Chairman Geoffrey Robertson)

CLAIM sentence:  The conclusions of the report were unambiguous about what such reforms should entail

CLAIM sentence:  It recommended substantive changes to the Press Council and indeed to the existing law

CLAIM sentence:  Recommendations for reform of the Press Council included the further and oft repeated call for the development of a published code of conduct, auditing powers to ensure the maintenance of high standards, as well as powers, backed by contract, to direct prominent publication of corrections

CLAIM sentence:  The Robertson Report also recommended that the Press Council be given responsibility for the training and professional development of journalists

CLAIM sentence:   Bingham, A, Drinking in the Last Chance Saloon: The British press and the crisis of self-regulation, -, p  Labour Party, The People and the Media  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op Cit, p  Part D | StandardsD\xc

CLAIM sentence:  this report also went much further in its recommendations than just proposals for the reform of the Press Council

CLAIM sentence:  It also recommended substantive legislative change

CLAIM sentence:  Proposals put forward by the CPF included legislation to establish a statutory press ombudsman, to provide a defence in law for investigative journalism, a Freedom of Information Act and changes to the laws on libel and contempt

CLAIM sentence:  Reference has already been made to examples of press misconduct in the s, but it would be incorrect to suggest that the Press Council was always silent in these circumstances

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, in material submitted by Sir Louis to the Inquiry, he has made clear his belief that the Press Council ultimately failed because its rulings were routinely, though not always, traduced and undermined in the pages of newspapers, thereby only serving to undermine public confidence in that body

CLAIM sentence:  The perceived inability of the Press Council to take credible and effective action in these cases of press mistreatment further damaged its reputation

CLAIM sentence:  Increasingly, it was regarded as ineffective both as a regulator of press conduct and as a means of redress for those who had suffered harm

CLAIM sentence:  Consequent opprobrium at the Press Council was not restricted to those who were the victims of press misconduct, but also extended to policy makers and to some of those involved in the industry

CLAIM sentence:  Already in , the NUJ had withdrawn its membership from the Press Council on the grounds that it was not only incapable of internal reform but also was not able effectively to improve the behaviour of the press

CLAIM sentence:  Parliamentary concern at the behaviour of some parts of the press was such that in  two Private Members Bills were put before Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  These were intended to address the intrusive practices conducted by some journalists and the lack of redress available to those who had been the victims of them

CLAIM sentence:  His Bill proposed the introduction of a privacy tort, envisaged as a means of helping to protect individuals from unwarranted intrusion by the press

CLAIM sentence:  The second such Bill was introduced by Tony Worthington, a Labour MP

CLAIM sentence:  This proposed the creation of a statutory Press Commission Appeal Tribunal with legally enforceable sanctions

CLAIM sentence:  The Labour MP Austin Mitchell also introduced a Bill requiring a right of reply

CLAIM sentence:  In  a number of yet further attempts were made to introduce legislation to curb the worst excesses of press misbehaviour

CLAIM sentence: to consider what measures (whether legislative or otherwise) are needed to give further protection to individual privacy from the activities of the press and improve recourse against the press for the individual citizen

CLAIM sentence:  Sir David published his report on Privacy and Related Matters in June 

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear from the content of the report that the members of the Committee considered its remit to go beyond a limited discussion of privacy and encompass the existing system of press regulation

CLAIM sentence:  The final report was highly critical of the Press Council and set out in clear terms the failings of that organisation

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, it recommended that the Press Council should be abolished and replaced with a new self-regulatory organisation; the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)

CLAIM sentence:  The report argued that the press be given: 

CLAIM sentence: one final chance to prove that voluntary self-regulation can be made to work

CLAIM sentence:  However, we do not consider that the Press Council, even if reformed as proposed in its internal review, should be kept as part of the system

CLAIM sentence:  We therefore recommend that the Press Council should be disbanded and replaced by a new body, specifically charged with adjudicating on complaints of press malpractice

CLAIM sentence:  This body must be seen to be authoritative, independent and impartial

CLAIM sentence:  It must also have jurisdiction over the press as a whole, must be adequately funded and must provide a means of seeking to prevent publication of intrusive material

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Home Office (), Report into Privacy and Other Matters, passim, especially

CLAIM sentence:   ibid, pp-, paras 

CLAIM sentence:  The new body should, therefore, be called the Press Complaints Commission

CLAIM sentence:  The report recommended that this new body should deal with the numerous and substantial concerns that had been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the press

CLAIM sentence:  In contrast to the three Royal Commissions, the Calcutt Committee did not make a large number of recommendations for specific reforms

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, it set out a framework of measures that the Committee regarded as the necessary elements of an effective self-regulatory regime

CLAIM sentence:  The new PCC would have  months to demonstrate that non-statutory self-regulation can be made to work effectively by implementing appropriate reforms

CLAIM sentence: large-scale and deliberate flouting of the code of practice by the press or a total collapse in standards, then a statutory system for handling complaints should be introduced

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Davids report made clear that the primary function of the PCC should be to provide effective redress for complaints made by members of the public against the press, including the ability to consider allegations of unfair treatment and unwarranted infringements of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the Commission was to publish, monitor and implement a comprehensive code of practice for the guidance of both the press and the public, as well as to operate a  hour hotline for complainants

CLAIM sentence:  Sir David also recommended that the PCC should be able to advise on the form and placing of replies or corrections

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, Sir Davids report made a small number of specific recommendations about the structure and function of the PCC, intended to address concerns expressed by the three Royal Commissions as to the independence of the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  The Press Council was duly disbanded, and in the spring of  the five publishing associations in the UK (the Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Society, the Periodical Publishers Association, Scottish Newspapers Publishers Association and the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society) worked together to establish the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) for the specific purpose of funding the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Although the PCC had been established speedily, standards of press behaviour remained a concern to politicians and members of the public alike because no immediate improvement in press behaviour was discerned

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed it has been suggested that despite the speed and promise of its establishment, the PCC quickly followed the modus operandi demonstrated by the Press Council in its responses to the Royal Commissions and Sir Kenneth Youngers report on privacy in 

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, the Code of Conduct was promulgated by the industry rather than the PCC itself and, as indicated above, the appointments process was not independent

CLAIM sentence:  The Commission also struggled to impose its authority on the industry; it has been argued that, in failing to commit to dealing with complaints from third parties, or indeed establish any investigatory arm, the regulatory function and capacity of the newly formed Commission was gravely weakened from the outset

CLAIM sentence:  The Bill proposed the creation of a statutory Independent Press Authority, with powers to enforce its rulings through the courts

CLAIM sentence:  Clive (now Lord) Soley has suggested that his Private Members Bill was intended to complement thinking around Sir Davids forthcoming follow-up review

CLAIM sentence:  He described the press as drinking in the last chance saloon

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps with greater ambiguity, he has also suggested that some of that coverage was legitimate and a matter of public interest

CLAIM sentence:  In July , Sir David Calcutt was asked by the Secretary of State for National Heritage to conduct a second review, the report from which was published in January 

CLAIM sentence:  David Mellors explanation to the Inquiry was that  months had elapsed since the press had been described by him as drinking in the last chance saloon in December , and the matter needed to be re-assessed

CLAIM sentence:  He summarised his conclusions as follows: The Press Complaints Commission is not, in my view, an effective regulator of the press

CLAIM sentence:  It has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of practice, which enables it to command not only press but also public confidence

CLAIM sentence:  It does not, in my view, hold the balance fairly between the press and the individual

CLAIM sentence:  It is not the truly independent body which it should be

CLAIM sentence:  He therefore recommended that the proposals set out in his first report for a statutory Press Complaints Tribunal be enacted forthwith: It has been argued that two years is too short a time in which to judge the Press Complaints Commission

CLAIM sentence:  But the way forward was clearly spelt out in the Privacy Committees Report

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, the Committee stressed the need for the Commission to be seen as an independent body which would command the confidence of the public

CLAIM sentence:  Both the Committee, and subsequently the Government, gave a clear indication that this was the last chance for the industry to put its own house in order

CLAIM sentence:  It has to be assumed that the industry, in setting up the present Press Complaints Commission, has gone as far as it was prepared to go

CLAIM sentence:  But it has not gone far enough

CLAIM sentence:  The final report contained a detailed set of proposals for the wide-ranging powers that should be granted to that body

CLAIM sentence:  These included powers to establish and maintain a code of practice, prevent the publication of material in breach of the code, handle complaints in relation to alleged breaches of the code (including from third parties), investigate and adjudicate on breaches without a complaint, require the publication of adjudications, apologies and corrections, and, where appropriate, to hold full hearings

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC said that the criticism of it was excessive

CLAIM sentence:  Specifically, amendments were made to the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Other changes included new guidance on how journalists should identify themselves when seeking  David Calcutt QC, Review of Press Self-regulation, pxi,   ibid, pxi   ibid, pp-  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Similar changes were also made to the independent Appointments Committee

CLAIM sentence:  In further changes, the industry agreed that the PCC should be granted powers to ratify, if so advised, the changes to the Editors Code of Practice recommended by the Editors Code of Practice Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Funding to the Commission was also increased substantially

CLAIM sentence:  This enabled the development and introduction of a hotline for members of the public specifically to deal with incidents of harassment by members of the press, as had been recommended in Sir Davids first report

CLAIM sentence:  He recalled that in  the Sunday Mirror published photographs of the Princess of Wales exercising in a private gym

CLAIM sentence:  Lord McGregor, then Chairman of the PCC, issued a public rebuke of the Sunday Mirror; but instead of showing contrition the papers response was to leave the system of self-regulation through the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Brooke suggested that this incident was instructive at many levels, demonstrating not only the weaknesses existing within the system of regulation, but also the refusal of the press to begin to countenance change until compelled to do so as a consequence of public indignation at its behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Sir John also suggested that the strength of Parliamentary opinion in relation to freedom of the press, particularly in the  p, lines -, Lord Brooke, http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning- Hearing--May-

CLAIM sentence:  These included both a privacy tort and proposals to make some forms of intrusion a criminal offence

CLAIM sentence:  Stephen Dorrell, the Secretary of State for National Heritage from July  to July , was responsible for the formulation but not the publication of the response to the second Calcutt report

CLAIM sentence:  He has helped complete this picture

CLAIM sentence:  Nonetheless, many have suggested that Lord Wakehams appointment and tenure was very much in the interest of the press

CLAIM sentence:  And I cant imagine you being a very good chairman of a Press Council if you didnt believe in press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  I would have thought they were pretty self-evidently things that were required for the job

CLAIM sentence:  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales in  was a wake-up call for the press

CLAIM sentence:  Although it did not generate a specific inquiry into press ethics, it did reignite a public demand for improvements in press behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Considered as a whole, the reforms introduced in response to the public outcry were the most comprehensive ever introduced by the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  It should not be doubted that the reforms, which concerned amendments to clauses  and  of the Editors Code of Practice, did have an impact on the behaviour and actions of journalists, press photographers and paparazzi

CLAIM sentence:  Nonetheless, it is apparent from the evidence that these changes were, as so many before, hard won from the industry and not freely given

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith provided a detailed description of the protracted negotiations between his Department and the industry through the offices of the PCC, in which despite the tragic background, the quite extraordinary levels of public  p, lines -, Lord Wakeham, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Rather the changes that were finally adopted were confined to those very few areas outlined above most closely associated with the direct circumstances surrounding the death of Princess Diana

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith testified that the industry demonstrated a disinclination to agree to any changes and did so only under duress after considerable public and political pressure was brought to bear

CLAIM sentence:  He said that over a period of months the attitude of the PCC shifted from operating as a regulator to championing the interests of the press

CLAIM sentence:  This was a metamorphosis which it may be argued was as inevitable and it was entirely understandable, as other real world concerns impacted, in particular in relation to the possible ramifications for the press of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the reforms to the Editors Code of Practice that were introduced with effect from  January  were neither welcomed by the press nor much observed in the longer term

CLAIM sentence:  carried through, sometimes, I suspect, with gritted teeth amongst the editors and proprietors, because there was a public wind at the back of change

CLAIM sentence:  But that moment did not last for terribly long, and the equilibrium returned more or less to normal, which makes it very difficult for government to take strident steps to restrain press activity

CLAIM sentence:  But he, along with other witnesses to the Inquiry, stressed that the changes in press behaviour were of short duration: I think its probably fair to say that for the two or three years following the Wakeham changes immediately after the death of Diana, the conduct of the press did improve

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly in terms of the specifics of the changes, their approach to the coverage of the princes, handling of children and minors, some of the intrusive taking of photographs, there was a palpable change of behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  The industry moved quickly to make a number of high profile but nevertheless limited changes which were in any event only begrudgingly accepted

CLAIM sentence:  At this juncture, it is opportune that I seek to draw out some brief lessons from the history of press self-regulation in the UK since the foundation of the General Council for the Press in , as well as the public policy response to concerns at the conduct of some sections of the press

CLAIM sentence:  It must be made clear that the story is not all bad, in the sense that there have been a number of reforms in press regulation since the Second World War

CLAIM sentence:  That said, whilst recognising some of the good work that has been done in response to criticism, to changing attitudes and the clear recommendations of the reports, it is evident that many of the lessons of the post-war period have been ignored

CLAIM sentence:  An equally strong recurrence has been concern about the inability of self-regulation to address the underlying problem sufficiently, an inability which has been consistently pointed out by all of those who have examined the problem in depth

CLAIM sentence:  The history demonstrates a distinct and enduring resistance to change from within the press

CLAIM sentence:  My conclusion on the cyclical nature of press self-regulation is not a novel one

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, it was shared by many of the witnesses to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Brooke suggested that the history of press self-regulation has been one of a distinct reluctance on the part of the industry to implement meaningful change

CLAIM sentence:  He noted that such change that has been effected has only been implemented in the face of the very real threat of statutory intervention: But in the period since , I observe that quite extraneous events, like a Private Members Bill, actually have had the effect of moving the story on quite a lot

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that in his view the history of press reform is one of failure to introduce measures recommended in terms to improve public trust in both the press and the system of selfregulation

CLAIM sentence: pdf  p, lines -, ibid  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xcbefore the press and an awful lot of leaning on and threats of legislation before the press will set something up

CLAIM sentence:  That, if you look through the history, and this is another thing that Hacked Off is doing, that sort of conduct is repeated and repeated

CLAIM sentence:  However, in a somewhat different vein from other commentators, the Mediawise Trust suggested that it is incorrect to describe the history as cyclical, as this tends to obscure the fact that the calls for reform became increasingly strident and more forthright with time, and the refusal of the press to implement the changes at the heart of those reports more obdurate

CLAIM sentence:  Those who complain about the conduct of the press are entitled to ask How many chances must the press be given before something is done about it? The problem is to decide whether that complaint is justified and, if it is, what that something is

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Dr-Martin- Moore

CLAIM sentence: pdf  ibid  although this question relates to the press generally, throughout this Report reference is usually made to a section of the press

CLAIM sentence:  As has been and will be emphasised, this is to underline the good work of most journalists and the enormous value that the press can bring to our democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  The fact that most of the press do not behave in a way that requires regulation does not, however, negate the need for such regulation to deal with those whose behaviour does not meet the high standards of the majority  Part D | StandardsD\xcD Chapter  Self-regulation of the preSS 

CLAIM sentence:  introduction This Chapter of the Report will look at the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) as the system of self-regulation that has existed for the press since 

CLAIM sentence:  Having examined the establishment of the PCC in the context of the publication of the first report into the press by Sir David Calcutt QC in June of that year, it will then look, in turn, at the powers, operation and standards of the PCC before considering both the role of Press Standards Board of Finance, which was established with the express purpose of providing sufficient funding for the PCC, and the Code Committee which is responsible for the promulgation, implementation and amendment of the Editors Code of Practice, the cornerstone of self-regulation through the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  This Chapter will also look at the operation of the Editors Code of Practice, together with the services that it offers to the public; this includes the anti-harassment hotline and its role as a complaints handling body

CLAIM sentence:  That exercise has therefore been deferred until these incidents (covering a number of years) have been fully ventilated: the Report therefore returns to the PCC below

CLAIM sentence:  The broad scope of Sir Davids Departmental Committee had reflected a growing concern in Parliament, as well as among the public more widely, about the behaviour of some parts of the press and the perceived failure of the Press Council, then the self-regulatory body for the press, to take effective action to deal with such behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Davids first report was published in June 

CLAIM sentence:  At that stage, he did not advocate the introduction of statutory controls

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, he recommended that the existing, and by this point largely discredited, Press Council should be abolished and replaced with a new self- regulatory organisation, the Press Complaints Commission, which should deal with the many and substantive concerns that had been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the press

CLAIM sentence:  The new PCC would have  months to demonstrate that non-statutory self-regulation can be made to work effectively

CLAIM sentence:  The primary function of the newly incorporated PCC was to provide an effective means of redress for complaints made by members of the public against the press, including the ability to consider accusations of unfair treatment and unwarranted infringements of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the Commission was to publish, monitor and implement a comprehensive code of practice for the guidance of both the press and the public, as well as to operate a -hour hotline for complainants

CLAIM sentence:  I now turn to the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  This set out standards of behaviour that journalists and editors should seek to uphold and also set down the rules by which the newspaper industry should adhere

CLAIM sentence:  The Editors Code of Practice was formulated by a Code Committee, formally a sub-committee of PressBoF which was made up of serving editors of both newspapers and magazines

CLAIM sentence:  The Code is explored in more detail below

CLAIM sentence:  Further, in a determined break with the past, the newly formed PCC also took a more proactive approach to dealing with some of the more challenging issues facing the press, producing a range of guidance which is valued by editors, particularly in the regional press

CLAIM sentence:  However, although the industry had moved quickly to set up the PCC, standards of press behaviour remained a concern to both politicians and members of the public who did not discern any immediate improvement in that behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  Reflecting that widespread concern, the then Home Office Minister, David Mellor QC MP, made clear his view in a television interview in , describing the press as drinking in the last chance saloon

CLAIM sentence:  In that report, which was published in January , Sir David argued that self-regulation by the PCC had failed and called for the introduction of a statutory Press Complaints Tribunal

CLAIM sentence:  However, the PCC did accept that some reform was required and changes were made to some of its policies and procedures in the light of the first  months of operational experience

CLAIM sentence:  Further changes were made in , after the Government had published its eventual response to Sir Davids second report and the PCC has continued to keep its practices under review since then

CLAIM sentence:  Purpose of the PCC The primary purpose of the PCC is set out in its Articles of Association

CLAIM sentence:  The primary function of the Commission shall be to consider, and adjudicate, conciliate and resolve or settle by reference to the Press Code of Practice promulgated  http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/assets//PCC_Articles_of_Association

CLAIM sentence: pdf  p, ibid  Part D | StandardsD\xcby PressBoF for the time being in force complaints from the public of unjust or unfair treatment by newspapers, periodicals or magazines and unwarranted infringements of privacy through material published in newspapers, periodicals or magazines (in each case excluding advertising by third parties) or in connection with the obtaining of such material but shall not consider complaints of any other nature

CLAIM sentence:  This is again set out in plain English on the PCC website in the form of a mission statement

CLAIM sentence:  In that statement, it is said that the PCC is: an independent body which administers the system of self-regulation for the press

CLAIM sentence:  It does so primarily by dealing with complaints, framed within the terms of the Editors Code of Practice, about the editorial content of newspapers and magazines and the conduct of journalists

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear from this that the PCC understood itself to be a de-facto regulator and presented itself publicly as such

CLAIM sentence:  This difference between this perception and the reality is explored below

CLAIM sentence:  Since its foundation in January , there has been five Chairs of the PCC

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Self-regulation of the Press\xcPCC, as set out at Article  which also established the appointments process for each class

CLAIM sentence:  The three classes of members of the Commission are as follows (see Article 

CLAIM sentence: ): the Chairman; (a) (b) public members; and (c) press (or editorial) members

CLAIM sentence:  It also makes clear that at all times a majority of the members shall be Public Members rather than Press Members

CLAIM sentence:  Commissioners also serve as Directors of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The most significant of the Articles of Association in this regard is Article 

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear that candidates for the post of PCC Chair are expected to have knowledge and expertise of the working of the press and also of regulation

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry was told candidates are also tested on this particular issue during the application process

CLAIM sentence:  The Public Members and Press Members of the PCC are appointed differently

CLAIM sentence:  According to the Articles of Association, Public Members and Press Members are appointed by the Appointments Commission (Article 

CLAIM sentence:  This Commission also has absolute discretion to appoint Public and Press Members upon whatever terms and for whatever period it sees fit

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, it has the power to revoke or to vary any appointment of a Public or Press member

CLAIM sentence:  makes clear that no Public Member shall be engaged in, or otherwise connected  Described as the Chair throughout the Report  p, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In practice, however, the Appointments Commission has been abolished and responsibility for the appointment of Public Members has been taken on by the Nominations Committee

CLAIM sentence:  This reform was introduced following the Governance Review in  but, at this point, has not yet been formalised as an amendment to the Articles of Association

CLAIM sentence:  The Nominations Committee is chaired by the PCC Chair and has two other members drawn from Public Members of the Commission

CLAIM sentence:  Vacancies for Public Members are advertised publicly

CLAIM sentence:  The Nominations Committee considers applications and then makes nominations for the whole of the Commission to vote upon

CLAIM sentence:  The Nominations Committee is also responsible for appointing the Independent Reviewer and the Review Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Press (or Editorial) Member appointments are made by the trade bodies through PressBoF

CLAIM sentence:  He briefly summarised the purpose of the Commission as: (a) (b) (c) to investigate complaints, primarily from concerned individuals, that relate to the terms of the Editors Code of Practice; to deal with pre-publication concerns of individuals and advocate on their behalf with news organisations, with a view to preventing the publication of non-compliant material; and to prevent harassment by journalists

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to this, the PCC also seeks pro-actively to contact individuals who might need the assistance of the Commission in their dealings with the press; provides guidance to the industry on a range of ethical issues (such as reporting on mental health issues); and works with titles to help raise standards across the industry

CLAIM sentence:  Investigating complaints that relate to the terms of the Editors Code of Practice The complaints process assessment 

CLAIM sentence:  One of the core functions of the PCC is the investigation of complaints relating to the terms of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Each new complaint is assessed by a complaints officer or the Head of Complaints; at this stage, any complaint which falls outside the remit of the PCC or the Code of Practice is sifted out

CLAIM sentence:  It may be the case that the PCC has to ask for further details before a decision can be taken about whether or not the complaint falls within its competence

CLAIM sentence:  Commonly when asked for further information complainants choose not to pursue their complaints  Chapter  | Self-regulation of the Press\xcWhen the PCC does not investigate 

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC does not investigate cases where no breach of the Code is raised in the complaint

CLAIM sentence:  Examples of this might include where the complaint was about a broadcaster, or where the complaint raised questions of taste and decency

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC might also decide that, if sufficient remedial action had been taken by a newspaper, no further action was necessary

CLAIM sentence:  When a complaint does not fall within the remit of the PCC, it will try to redirect the complainant to the relevant alternative regulator

CLAIM sentence:  Where a complaint is accepted for investigation, the PCC first writes to the editor of the relevant publication

CLAIM sentence:  That editor is sent a copy of the complaint and is asked to respond within seven days

CLAIM sentence:  There then follows three way correspondence, with the PCC Complaints Officer acting as the conduit between the complainant (or his/her representative) and the publication complained about

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has a protocol for disclosure

CLAIM sentence:  This document does not place either party under any obligation to provide key documents to the other party or to the PCC itself

CLAIM sentence:  It also provides that the PCC will consider on request providing to the complainant copies of our correspondence conducted during an investigation with editors

CLAIM sentence:  There is no obligation on a complainant or a publication to disclose to the other party or to the PCC documents which might undermine a partys own case or strengthen that of the other party

CLAIM sentence:  While the PCC does have the power to hold oral hearings, that power has never been exercised

CLAIM sentence:  On some occasions, the PCC has found that, after the conclusion of investigations, it has insufficient information to reconcile the positions of the parties and, as a consequence, has declined to come to any conclusion as to the merits of the complaint

CLAIM sentence:  There are other instances of PCC decisions in which the PCC has not upheld a complaint on the basis that there was not enough evidence for it to be sustained; on its face, however, it seems that if key documents were disclosed, the matter might have been resolved

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Part D | StandardsD\xcAction to prevent publication of material that does not comply with the PCC Code 

CLAIM sentence:  Where the police are involved, the PCC might seek to approach the subject or probable subject of stories through the police (such as contact with Cumbria police following the shootings by Derrick Bird); or through other representatives such as solicitors (as in the case of Christopher Jefferies)

CLAIM sentence:  Preventing harassment by journalists 

CLAIM sentence:  Harassment by journalists is covered by Clause  of the PCC Code

CLAIM sentence:  Where an individual asks a publication to desist from questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing him, the Code makes clear that publications should not persist in their pursuit of the individual

CLAIM sentence:  The system, referred to by some as a desist order, has been widely praised by both members of the public and those who have benefited from the system

CLAIM sentence:  The Articles of Association also make express a number of explicit limitations on the PCCs competence to consider complaints

CLAIM sentence:  These are: (a) (b) the PCC can only consider complaints made by the person affected or by a person authorised by him to make a complaint (Article 

CLAIM sentence: (a)); the PCC cannot consider a complaint where the matter complained of is the subject of proceedings in a court of law or tribunal in the United Kingdom (Article 

CLAIM sentence: (b)); and (c) where the person affected has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law in the United Kingdom, the PCC may consider the complaint if in the particular circumstances of the case it appears to the Commission that it is appropriate for the Commission to consider a complaint about it

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has only limited powers available to it

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, as already observed, the PCC has no power to subpoena documents

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC also has a range of sanctions available which, in brief, are: negotiation of an agreed remedy; (a) (b) publication of a critical adjudication; (c) (d) a letter of admonishment from the PCC Chairman to an editor; follow-up by the PCC to establish what steps have been taken to avoid a repeat of a breach and what steps have been taken against those responsible for breaches; and referral of an editor to his publisher

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has also pointed to the growing number of settled complaints as testament to the efficacy of the current sanctions regime

CLAIM sentence:  However, elsewhere in her evidence, she appeared to concede that the deterrent impact of an adverse adjudication from the PCC was not as effective as might have been suggested

CLAIM sentence:  She accepted that the anger she had experienced from editors when providing notice of a forthcoming adjudication was at the fact of personal criticism rather than its content and impact

CLAIM sentence:  In a further reflection on this point, Baroness Buscombe acknowledged that the current state of affairs impacted directly on levels of trust in the PCC and that, as a consequence, there was very real difficulty in persuading both policy makers and members of the public that an adverse adjudication was, in fact, an effective sanction

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to note in this context that the PCC has no power to enforce its adjudications or rulings if they are ignored by an editor or publisher

CLAIM sentence:  The lack of power in this respect has been the subject of some criticism and had already been identified as an issue to be reviewed by the PCC Reform Committee by February 

CLAIM sentence:  A further analysis of the punitive and deterrent impact of adjudications as a sanction is undertaken later in the Report

CLAIM sentence:  Options for appeal or review 

CLAIM sentence:  There is no avenue within the self-regulation system through which complainants can appeal against the substance of a PCC decision

CLAIM sentence:  On occasion, parties who have been informed of the substance of the outcome of adjudications in their cases have asked the PCC to reconsider its decision

CLAIM sentence:  However, when this happens, the PCC has only reviewed the process of the handling of the complaint and not the substance of the material decisions made

CLAIM sentence:  The function of the Charter Commissioner is defined under Articles  and  of Articles of Association as to: consider complaints (other than complaints relating to the substance of an adjudication) from persons who have received a decision from the Commission and who are dissatisfied with the way in which the Commission has handled their matter

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent Reviewer is now Professor Robert Pinker CBE: he served as a Public Member of the PCC between  and  and was Acting Chair in - and in 

CLAIM sentence:  The role of the Charter Commissioner was characterised in the  PCC Annual Report as being to operate a sort of internal system of judicial review

CLAIM sentence:  The Charter Commissioner is assisted in his work by the Charter Compliance Panel

CLAIM sentence:  In practice, the Charter Commissioner and the Charter Compliance Panel provide an avenue through which a complainant might refer his or her complaint if he or she believes that there had been some procedural defect in the way that the complaint had initially been handled

CLAIM sentence:  This role has, since the independent governance review, been included unaltered in the position of Independent Reviewer

CLAIM sentence:  Pro-active work by the PCC 

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC produces Guidance Notes to assist the industry with particular issues where there is an apparent need

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC also publishes Annual Reviews

CLAIM sentence:  Among other information, these contain statistics about the number and types of complaints received

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the PCC has in the past organised public events such as talks and Question & Answer sessions

CLAIM sentence:  PressBoF is a company limited by guarantee and was incorporated shortly before the inauguration of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The membership of the Board of PressBoF is set out under Article  of the Articles of Association

CLAIM sentence:  The structure of PressBoF is based loosely on the funding body for the Advertising Standards Authority

CLAIM sentence:  However, whilst the funding structure underpinning that organisation has been made public, that is not the case with the PCC or PressBoF

CLAIM sentence:  This has been the subject of both criticism and speculation

CLAIM sentence: , p  Part J, Chapter   Part D | StandardsD\xcof the levy, it also had a fundamental role in relation to the exercise of its functions, as all decisions relating to the role and remit of the PCC must first be ratified by PressBoF

CLAIM sentence:  Although the membership of the NPA was in the public domain, the details of who paid for what were not public or, indeed, shared with PressBoF, as members of the Board or PressBoF staff may have links with the individual publishing houses

CLAIM sentence:  Role of PressBoF in PCC appointments PressBoF also plays an important role in the appointment of personnel to the PCC,  including to the position of Chair

CLAIM sentence:  The process for the more recent appointment of Baroness Buscombe was more transparent, and was built around the public advertisement of the post in the national press

CLAIM sentence:  Further changes had since been made as a consequence of the independent review of the PCC governance processes; these were 

CLAIM sentence:  Following the resignation of Baroness Buscombe, the position of PCC Chair was advertised in the national press in August 

CLAIM sentence:  The independent assessor provided an audit note of the complete application process

CLAIM sentence:  Applications were made not to PressBoF but direct to the recruitment consultants

CLAIM sentence:  They drew up an initial long-list which was discussed with both the independent assessor and the PressBoF Board

CLAIM sentence:  Those discussions resulted in the production of a shorter list and prospective candidates were interviewed by the consultants in the first instance

CLAIM sentence:  At that point, a final shortlist of some  candidates was drawn up by PressBoF and formal interviews took place during September 

CLAIM sentence:  In the first instance, they were provided with an opportunity to put names forward for the post

CLAIM sentence:  Later, members were offered a meeting with Lord Hunt at which they were provided with an opportunity to give their views on the type of Chair they thought appropriate to the position

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Black said that he spoke with all lay members of the Commission, with one exception

CLAIM sentence:  He also emphasised that the most recent recruitment process had been open to applicants from all political parties

CLAIM sentence:  The Editors Code Committee 

CLAIM sentence:  The Code Committee is responsible for the wording of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  The Code Committee has also been responsible for producing the Editors Codebook, which brings together the Code and the PCC case law

CLAIM sentence:  The current Chair of the Code Committee is Paul Dacre, the editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  In his view, serving editors brought necessary expertise and industry knowledge to the system and, in particular, an awareness of the dilemmas faced by staff in newsrooms

CLAIM sentence:  He suggested that majority industry representation was normal for systems of self-regulation, and was certainly the case with regard to systems of press self-regulation globally

CLAIM sentence:  However, Lord Black did concede that public or independent representation on the Code Committee or a successor body would need to be considered going forward, particularly as this would be central to any effort in rebuilding public trust and confidence

CLAIM sentence:  He noted that his formal engagement with the Commission was rare, limited to one meeting each a year, the purpose of which was to update the Commission on the state of the industry

CLAIM sentence:  In his view, there was no capacity to exercise control over the function of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  It was not, therefore, subject to the same level of lay scrutiny and influence as the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, the only lay representation on the Editors Code of Practice Committee was through the Chair and Director of the PCC, who were entitled to attend in an ex-officio capacity

CLAIM sentence:  As neither were entitled to participate in discussions or in any decision- making capacity, it is clear that the influence of lay members on the Committee was limited

CLAIM sentence:  However, there was some recognition that this knowledge could be brought to bear by former editors or, indeed, other industry experts

CLAIM sentence:  He also acknowledged that credibility with the industry could also be achieved through other means, such as consultation on the content of a code with serving industry editors, rather than their direct input through representation on the Code Committee

CLAIM sentence:  On one occasion at least, the Code Committee had been required to play a role as arbiter of the meaning of a given provision of the PCC Code where the PCC found that there was ambiguity

CLAIM sentence:  On  September , Baroness Buscombe wrote to Ian Beales (Secretary to the Code Committee) asking for clarification of Clause  of the PCC Code (payments to witnesses)

CLAIM sentence:  The Editors Code of Practice 

CLAIM sentence:  The Editors Code of Practice is the cornerstone of the system of self-regulation for the press, and it is the responsibility of the PCC to ensure that the Code is properly enforced

CLAIM sentence:  It makes clear that these standards are set out in the Code of Practice, and that the Code acts as a benchmark for those ethical standards

CLAIM sentence:  Although there was later comment about ways in which the Code could be improved, witnesses to the Inquiry have, in the main, spoken favourably about its content

CLAIM sentence:  It has been praised by witnesses for being both readily understandable and usable

CLAIM sentence:  Even those witnesses who have been otherwise critical of the PCC, have spoken in favourable terms about the Code: for example, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, has described the Code as good

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC makes clear just how the Code should be interpreted by editors: the PCC website states that the Code should be honoured not only to the letter but in the full spirit

CLAIM sentence:  Issues around interpretation are elaborated further on the website, including the unambiguous statement that the Code should not be interpreted so narrowly as to compromise its commitment to respect the rights of the individual, nor so broadly that it constitutes an unnecessary interference with freedom of expression or prevents publication in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  Lastly, the PCC makes clear that it is the responsibility of editors and publishers to apply the Code to editorial material in both printed and online versions of publications

CLAIM sentence:  The Editors Code of Practice has developed through a process of iteration over the last two decades, responding to challenges and concern at the behaviour and actions of the press

CLAIM sentence:  The Code has now been amended on at least  occasions, most notably following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 

CLAIM sentence:  The most substantial of the amendments made to the Code of Practice have related to privacy and, in particular, the privacy of minors

CLAIM sentence:  Specifically, new wording was introduced to clause  in relation to privacy

CLAIM sentence:  This was largely drawn from the European Convention on Human Rights which, at the time the amendments to the Code of Practice were made, was about to be incorporated into UK law

CLAIM sentence:  Significantly, these amendments also altered the definition of a private place, to include both public and private places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  Changes were also made to Clause  on accuracy to cover photographic manipulation

CLAIM sentence:  Further amendments to the Code sought to address concerns around the alleged role and actions of the paparazzi in the death of Princess Diana and the manner in which some photographs were sought

CLAIM sentence:  To address these concerns, provisions on harassment were expanded and revised to include a ban in the use of information or pictures obtained through persistent pursuit

CLAIM sentence:  This new Clause  also made explicit the responsibility of the editor not to publish material that had been obtained in breach of this clause, regardless of whether the material had been obtained by the newspapers staff or by journalists or other staff employed on a freelance basis

CLAIM sentence:  A new clause  was also introduced, making explicit provision for the protection of the rights of children to privacy while they were at school (previously, this clause had referred only to children under the age of )

CLAIM sentence:  The revised clause  also forbade payments to minors or the parents or guardians of children for information involving the welfare of a child (unless demonstrably in the childs interest), and introduced a requirement for a justification for the publication of information about the private life of a child other than the fame, notoriety or position of his or her parents or guardian

CLAIM sentence:  The final changes saw the phrase should not replaced by must not throughout the Code, and the amendment of the section on the public interest to ensure that, in cases involving children, an editor must demonstrate an exceptional public interest to over-ride the normally paramount interests of the child

CLAIM sentence:  Despite these attempts to keep the Code updated, the Inquiry has heard some criticism about the opaqueness of the drafting process, as well as the limited opportunity afforded to members of the public to influence the process of amendment

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black indicated that there were a number of means through which the public could contribute to the amendment of the code

CLAIM sentence:  He specifically pointed to the annual review of the Code, which is undertaken by the Code Committee, during which suggestions for amendments were invited from Committee members, interested parties and the public

CLAIM sentence:  In practice, the Inquiry heard that the opinions and views offered by members of the public or from individuals outside of the newspaper industry were rarely heard

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black acknowledged, in response to questions about the influence of lay voices and views on the Committee, that, as the Committee was an Editors Code Committee, the voice of the press was bound to be predominant

CLAIM sentence:  However, he also suggested that this potential bias was mitigated by the breadth of freely voiced opinion across the Code Committee

CLAIM sentence:  He denied that any of these were sustainable criticisms, and suggested instead that the sustained level of funding by the industry for an independent system of self-regulation had brought about a number or real successes, including significant improvements to the behaviour of journalists and the press

CLAIM sentence:  He also suggested that a key, but hidden, success of the changes that stemmed from the Code of Practice was the increased tendency of editors to receive and deal with complaints themselves, particularly around accuracy, without referral to the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  However, he rejected the notion that this had the potential to affect the overall balance of the Editors Code of Practice by the Code Committee, by giving greater weight to the issue of press freedom, noting that there was only one member of PressBoF who sat on the Code Committee

CLAIM sentence:  He did, however, concede that the  members of the Code Committee (editors in their own right) would have clear and deeply held views of their own on press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  Witnesses from the PCC were clear about the benefits of a system of self-regulation for the press

CLAIM sentence:  They suggested that any form of statutory regulation for the press in the UK would also undermine the efficacy of the ex-ante interventions currently undertaken by the PCC, particularly work intended to stop the publication of particularly damaging or defamatory articles

CLAIM sentence:  If this function were passed to a statutory body open to political capture then the potential for abuse of that function would have worrying and significant implications for freedom of expression

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Grade also suggested that, given the nature of complaints directed to the PCC, speed of resolution is of primary importance to the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Hunt said that he firmly believed in the value of self-regulation above formal statutory regulation, which he suggested was open to political interference

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, he suggested that independent, voluntary, self regulation of the press, for the press and in the public interest was preferable and the optimal of the available approaches

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Hunt also suggested it is only by the press working together that a system of regulation such as that outlined by Sir David Calcutt in his second report can be achieved

CLAIM sentence:  She noted the harm that could be done to individuals as a consequence of drawn out court processes

CLAIM sentence:  In her evidence to the Inquiry, Baroness Buscombe suggested that the collaborative structure of the PCC was a strength

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Hunt also suggested to the Inquiry that a regulatory regime backed in statute would not be sufficiently flexible as an independent self-regulatory system

CLAIM sentence:  In particular he worried that a regime backed in statute would not be able to respond to new challenges as they emerged, as such a system would require changes to the law and would be beholden to the Parliamentary timetable

CLAIM sentence:  Although Lord Hunt conceded that it was perfectly possible to base the new system on legislation that was not proscriptive, he suggested that his experiences as a Parliamentarian led him to believe that legislation could rarely account adequately for future circumstances

CLAIM sentence:  anti-harassment policy 

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC operates an anti-harassment hotline for the general public through which an individual might communicate a desire for press attention to cease to newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  Such a request may result in the Commission issuing a desist order to newspapers after which press attention in the person in question should cease

CLAIM sentence:  This states that journalists: must not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on their property when asked to leave and must not follow them

CLAIM sentence:  If requested, they must identify themselves and whom they represent

CLAIM sentence:  The anti-harassment service is intended, therefore, to provide members of the public and other individuals affected by the actions and behaviour of journalists with the means of making express the terms of the Clause  of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC will also request an email setting out the concern or allegation from the individual in question

CLAIM sentence:  He provided the example of a grieving family who might contact the PCC ahead of an inquest or funeral, to make their wishes known

CLAIM sentence:  He noted that in such circumstance the PCC will act to disseminate their position immediately

CLAIM sentence:  I note that in this regard, the PCC has produced specific guidance both for bereaved individuals and also for journalists in relation to grief and intrusion into grief

CLAIM sentence:  This guidance has been disseminated to all UK police forces and coroners courts

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has said in evidence that the anti-harassment service also had an application for individuals in the public eye

CLAIM sentence:  It was explained that a desist order acted as a check on the publication of paparazzi photographs obtained through harassment

CLAIM sentence:  He noted further that: This places the onus on the editor to take care over the publication of photographs of the affected individual

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC suggested that the use of the anti-harassment service was the most effective means currently available of influencing paparazzi

CLAIM sentence:  A desist notice is an internal PCC term for a notice in relation to Clause  of the Editors Code of Practice (harassment)

CLAIM sentence:  At the time of writing, the PCC had issued  desist notices since January  (as set out in Table D

CLAIM sentence:  I note that, whilst there is no significant variance in the recorded monthly figures, the trend is towards the more frequent issue of these notices

CLAIM sentence:  This additional evidence was submitted in response to comments made in evidence by Gillian Shearer, the Communications Director for the Cumbrian Police Force, in relation to shootings in Whitehaven in Cumbria in July 

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Shearer described what she regarded as the aggressiveness of the press, the impact on the families concerned and the failure by the press to adhere to the police notice requesting that the media respect the families wishes for privacy

CLAIM sentence:  She also criticised what she suggested was the failure of the PCC to respond meaningfully both to events but also the wishes of those individuals affected

CLAIM sentence:  In the evidence he has provided to the Inquiry, Michael McManus, the Transitional Director of the PCC, has sought to correct this perception of the actions of the PCC; he provided the Inquiry with a detailed description of the PCCs activities in response to events in Whitehaven

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the PCC issued a private advisory notice on behalf of one individual who had become the subject of unwanted media attention and handled a number of formal complaints about published material

CLAIM sentence:  It is also clear that the PCC undertook a great deal of work in relation to events in Whitehaven

CLAIM sentence:  It is right to record that the PCC provided some assistance to Professor John Ashton, chair of the West Cumbria Shootings Recovery Group, in drafting a letter to the media requesting restraint ahead of the formal start of Inquest hearings in 

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC also worked with the police and Coroner to identify those individuals who had decided not to speak to the media; the Commission circulated a desist request on their behalf, requesting that they not be con- tacted

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear that the work of the PCC was wide-ranging

CLAIM sentence:  In May , the PCC organised a public meeting in Carlisle to enable local communities to speak to its representatives

CLAIM sentence:  The panel also included the then editor of the News and Star (Carlisle), Neil Hodgkinson

CLAIM sentence:  Although the PCC website provides clear advice on the services available to members of the public with regard to harassment by journalist and photographers, it also sets a number of steps that the affected parties should follow before contacting the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  In certain circumstances, these steps might prove to be unduly difficult or, indeed, impossible to fulfil

CLAIM sentence:  They depend both on the goodwill and cooperation of the journalists and press photographers involved, as well as on the substantive efforts of the affected party who, feasibly, might not be in a position to comply with the suggested steps

CLAIM sentence:  Say that you understand that under the Code of Practice journalists must not persist in contacting you having been asked to desist

CLAIM sentence:  It will help if you tell them that you are saying the same to every journalist

CLAIM sentence:  This applies however a journalist is approaching you whether it is at home, in a public place or over the telephone

CLAIM sentence:  You should then be left alone

CLAIM sentence:  If you are not, see point , below

CLAIM sentence:  If you are at home and too distressed to answer your door, pin a short note to it to say that you do not wish to speak to journalists and do not want to be disturbed

CLAIM sentence:  However, whilst the PCC guidance with regard to harassment is in most respects clear, there are significant caveats and exemptions to desist notices

CLAIM sentence:  In those cases where it has been impossible for the individuals concerned to establish the names of the journalists or newspapers in question, the PCC makes no claim to be able to take action

CLAIM sentence:  Even then, however, the website still encourages members of the public in such circumstances; it states thereafter that the PCC: may then be able to communicate your concerns across the industry as a whole via a general desist message, which should alleviate the problem

CLAIM sentence:  Lastly, it is also important to underline that the website states that, in those cases in which there is a perceived public interest, there is no obligation on the part of the press to heed a desist notice

CLAIM sentence:  The website does not, however, elucidate what any public interest might be, and does not provide the public and more specifically the users of the service with any degree of certainty or clarity on this important issue

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps of more importance, it leaves those individuals and their families who may already be in some distress open to continued and unwarranted press attention

CLAIM sentence:  Before doing so, there is value is in setting into context the complaints handling process operated by the Commission

CLAIM sentence:  First, it is worth noting that the level of complaints received by the PCC is neither disproportionate nor excessive; the number received by the Irish Press Ombudsman is broadly similar, when adjusted for population, as is the number received by Ofcom, in relation to content

CLAIM sentence:  The number of complaints rejected by the PCC is also comparable to the numbers rejected by Ofcom

CLAIM sentence:  It is also important that the Inquiry provides a context to any discussion of the complaint- handling process with the detail of the volume of complaints considered by the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Exact figures have not been provided to the Inquiry, but it has been suggested by witnesses that the PCC budget was only just sufficient for its purposes and only just stretched to cover these costs, with no remainder for any other actual or proposed function

CLAIM sentence:  This raises serious questions about the ability of the model proposed by Lord Black to provide for an investigatory arm within the funding envelope suggested

CLAIM sentence:  It has been suggested that such a figure can only be reached if all complaints are understood to have been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly, witnesses to the Inquiry have recognised that the secretariat and, in particular, the complaints handling staff at the PCC make considerable effort to be courteous and helpful

CLAIM sentence:  The MediaWise Trust, an independent press watchdog that monitors the behaviour of the press, has noted that in the surveys of complainants that they have undertaken, respondents score the staff highly against these criteria

CLAIM sentence:  Complainants also appreciate the speed with which PCC staff deal with issues raised by complainants in the course of the complaints

CLAIM sentence:  PCC witnesses to the Inquiry have certainly drawn attention to the apparent satisfaction at the speed of the complaint-handling process and the value placed on this by complainants

CLAIM sentence:  Given that most editors dislike the personal criticism inherent in any upheld adjudication, it is unsurprising that they will work hard to reach a resolution to the satisfaction of the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  However, in evidence presented to the Inquiry, the Media Standards Trust has suggested that this figure is misleading as it takes account of complaints which do not fall into the jurisdiction of the PCC and are therefore rejected

CLAIM sentence:  That said, there are limits to the analysis of any of the PCC data, as the Commission publishes information which omits the date on which a complaint is received

CLAIM sentence:  The website also explains that the PCC will also consider complaints brought in relation to the behaviour of journalists

CLAIM sentence:  These are: Persistent pursuit of individuals Refusing requests to stop taking photos or asking questions Using hidden cameras to obtain material Failing to be sensitive when dealing with cases involving grief and shock Failing to obtain the proper consent before speaking to children or people in hospital

CLAIM sentence:  The website further explains that Complaints have to be judged against the terms of Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  The website also explains the limited circumstances in which third parties are able to make complaints

CLAIM sentence:  Such complaints will be considered by the Commission only in those circumstances where the third party has signed authorisation to act on behalf of the individual concerned

CLAIM sentence:  This evidence chimes with that received from a number of groups who drew attention to the difficulties they have encountered in the face of this policy

CLAIM sentence:  However, the policy of the PCC has not been entirely inflexible, in particular in the fairly limited number of cases where a single article has given rise to a very large number of complaints

CLAIM sentence:  In some instances, complaints received from third parties may cause the PCC to contact the subject named in the article in question, or someone directly affected by that article, to consider whether they would take forward a complaint

CLAIM sentence:  An article published by the Mail on Sunday about the singers death, written by columnist Jan Moir in , prompted a record number of complaints from members of the public to the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, the PCC did not uphold the complaint, although it considered that the article had come close to breaching the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC website clearly sets out a timetable for members of the public seeking to bring a complaint against a newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, in most circumstances, the PCC will not accept complaints made more than two months after the date of publication (or over two months after the end of direct correspondence between a given complainant and an editor, provided that correspondence was entered into straight away)

CLAIM sentence:  The same section of the website also explains that complainants can formally submit a complaint to the PCC if the newspaper in question has failed to respond to the complaint within one week of the receipt of that complaint, but goes on to say that if the article in question remains available on the publications website, this time limitation does not usually apply

CLAIM sentence:  Resolution can take the form of published apologies, the correction of the content in question in a future edition, the removal of the offending article from the titles archives or online editions, or private letters of apology

CLAIM sentence:  In a limited number of circumstances, resolution might also include ex-gratia payments or donations to charities or other organisations

CLAIM sentence:  Some witnesses to the Inquiry have complained about what they regarded as an unnecessary slow process that was prone to delay

CLAIM sentence:  Some have said that lengthy periods between correspondence and delay were not uncommon

CLAIM sentence:  In its evidence, Full Fact provided details of a number of complaints, including one about an article published in the Evening Standard, where that newspaper did not respond until two months after the initial submission to the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The majority of complaints submitted to the PCC and ruled admissible are settled through a process of informal mediation between the complainant and the title in question

CLAIM sentence:  Complainants have a period of one month to appeal in writing to the Independent Reviewer should they wish to contest the PCCs decision (although, as already identified, the Independent Reviewer will only look at the way that the PCC handled the complaint and not its merits)

CLAIM sentence:  Data for ,  and  suggests a similarly high proportion of complaints were resolved through informal mediation processes (

CLAIM sentence:  These figures  This data is however limited in its accuracy and use, as the date of the complainants complaint is not included in the data published by the Commission  p, lines -, Will Moy, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Unfortunately, these figures do not relate to figures published in relation to complaints in the PCC Annual Reviews for , , and 

CLAIM sentence:  Those Reviews refer to complaints received in a given year, and break down the details into somewhat different categories

CLAIM sentence:  It has been suggested by the PCC that the very large number of cases resolved informally, and through no process of adjudication by the PCC or the sustained intervention of the PCC through mediation, represented a substantial and hidden success of self-regulation

CLAIM sentence:  Others have claimed that the odds are heavily stacked against the complainant, and that the PCC does not always appear to be neutral

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Christopher Meyer also rejected the characterisation of the complaints-handling process as attritional, in which intense pressures were placed on the complainant to resolve issues through mediation rather than pursuing a decision through the PCC and that the effort in reaching that resolution wass made disproportionately by the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  In that regard, there have been criticisms that the press is already far too over-regulated with particular reference to the complications of the ever-changing criminal and regulatory law, itself requiring training for journalists, as well as the equally ever-developing civil law

CLAIM sentence:  In this second category falls not only the jurisprudence in this country (in respect of which particular criticism has been made of the law of defamation) but also the effect of the Human Rights Act , which gave further effect in domestic law to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  (Cmd

CLAIM sentence:  That has led to litigation involving the press that has not infrequently been taken through the UK courts and has then been the subject of further argument before the European Court of Human Rights

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of this Inquiry is not to analyse the law in any depth but, in order to provide a wider picture to anyone interested in the issues affecting the press, it is necessary to provide some background in relation to the criminal law, the civil law and the regulatory framework provided by the Data Protection Act 

CLAIM sentence:  Where the law touches upon specific issues which fall within the Terms of Reference, a degree of analysis will follow in the text

CLAIM sentence:  Otherwise, a general outline has been provided in Appendices to the Report

CLAIM sentence:  Nobody should rely on the Appendices as a complete review of the nuances of the law: there are text books for that purpose

CLAIM sentence:  It is intended only to identify the broad landscape

CLAIM sentence:  The criminal law can touch upon the work of journalists in many ways and inevitably prescribes the ways in which it is acceptable for stories to be obtained

CLAIM sentence:  A brief summary of aspects of the criminal law most likely to be engaged in the pursuit of journalism is at Appendix  but it is neither complete in detail nor is it comprehensive

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the substantive criminal law, it is also necessary to consider aspects of criminal procedure which recognise the important place that journalism plays in our society and accords to journalists special protection in relation to journalistic material

CLAIM sentence:  The restrictions and limitations on the powers of the police to search for or seize such material add to the privileges that society gives to those involved in this work: they are summarised in Appendix 

CLAIM sentence:  The same is so for the civil law

CLAIM sentence:  Developments have undeniably broadened the focus in defamation beyond meaning, justification and fair comment

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, new concerns surround the concept of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  This has developed with the increasing recognition of the significance of Article  of the ECHR which, subject to exceptions, provides for everyone the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence

CLAIM sentence:  News Group Newspapers Ltd [] EWHC QB  paras  and   \xcPART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil Law parallel to Article , however, is Article  which, similarly subject to exceptions, provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers

CLAIM sentence:  A brief summary of the most important aspects of the civil law insofar as it affects journalism or journalists is set out at Appendix 

CLAIM sentence:  Again, it is not intended to be exhaustive

CLAIM sentence:  A separate analysis has been completed in relation to the law of data protection (see Appendix )

CLAIM sentence:  That is because it has criminal, civil and regulatory aspects and stands outside the areas of law so far outlined with the Information Commissioner being accorded, by statute, powers and responsibilities which go beyond the power to prosecute, or to commence civil proceedings

CLAIM sentence:  Given that the Terms of Reference specifically cover the extent to which the current policy and regulatory framework has failed including in relation to data protection the remit of the Information Commissioner will require detailed analysis beyond the brief synopsis of the legislative framework

CLAIM sentence:  Against the background of this framework, this Part of the Report will focus chronologically on the criminal investigations that have been undertaken both in relation to data protection and interception of mobile telephones, the outcome of those investigations and the reaction not only at the time but as further material entered the public domain

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of this Part of the Report is to provide what is a vital narrative to the background against which the criticisms of the culture, practices and ethics of the press (or part of the press) can be considered

CLAIM sentence:  It starts with the police operations that led to Operation Motorman, which was an investigation that fell to the Information Commissioner

CLAIM sentence:  In , the Devon and Cornwall Police were investigating an allegation of blackmail in Plymouth which sprang from the fact that a member of the public had obtained details of the criminal convictions of someone else

CLAIM sentence:  Not surprisingly, the police were concerned to discover how those details had been obtained and, in the course of the investigation, evidence was uncovered that an officer serving with the same force had accessed the Police National Computer (PNC) record of the victim

CLAIM sentence:  It was suspected that he had passed the information to individuals working as private investigators, and that the information had ultimately reached the hands of the suspect

CLAIM sentence:  In December , therefore, a series of searches of various premises, which supported that concern, were carried out

CLAIM sentence:  Material was seized which indicated that police officers and support staff from the force had been obtaining details of criminal convictions and information about the keepers of identified vehicles which were stored on police computer systems and then passing that information to private investigators, who would in turn pass it onto their customers

CLAIM sentence:  The private investigators were, in the main, retired police officers

CLAIM sentence:  E Thus, in January , Operation Reproof was initiated

CLAIM sentence:  The Senior Investigating Officer for that investigation has now retired: his deputy, now Detective Chief Superintendent Middleton (then holding the rank of Detective Inspector) gave evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The information was then passed through a network of individuals before it reached the ultimate customer

CLAIM sentence:  In most cases that ultimate customer was three or four links up the chain

CLAIM sentence:  The police sought to identify all the links in the chain and ascertain who in the chain knew that the information had been obtained unlawfully

CLAIM sentence:  The police found no evidence that the companies were aware that the information was being obtained illegally

CLAIM sentence:  The investigation also showed that serving and retired officers from other police forces were involved in similar illegal activities, and had links with the suspects in Devon and Cornwall

CLAIM sentence:  The investigation led the police to a data gathering company based in Surrey called Data Research Ltd

CLAIM sentence:  Data Research featured heavily as the third link in the chain

CLAIM sentence:  As it happened, at the same time, the Information Commissioner was conducting an investigation into the same company

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , the police executed a search warrant at the companys offices during the course of which a significant amount of information was found which indicated that data had been obtained unlawfully from the DVLA

CLAIM sentence:  This information formed the basis of Operation Motorman, an investigation then also conducted by the Information Commissioner (ICO) which has formed an important part of the narrative to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  From this investigation, the ICO passed material to the MPS, which gave rise to Operation Glade

CLAIM sentence:  For convenience, having dealt with Operation Reproof, the narrative will pass on to Operation Glade and then to Operation Motorman

CLAIM sentence:  The upshot was that two serving police officers, two retired police officers and two individuals associated with Data Research Ltd were charged with misconduct in public office offences and Data Protection Act offences

CLAIM sentence:  On  October  a pre-trial hearing took place at Exeter Crown Court before the trial judge, His Honour Judge Darlow

CLAIM sentence:  The defence argued that the proceedings should be stayed for an abuse of process

CLAIM sentence:  Although not directly relevant to this abuse of process submission, the defence also contended that accessing the databases and the subsequent passing of information obtained to insurance companies was not that serious and that unlawfully accessing the PNC could not amount to the criminal offence of misconduct in public office

CLAIM sentence:  The prosecution argued that the unlawful disclosure of the information was serious, irrespective of the use to which the data was intended to be put

CLAIM sentence:  He roundly rejected the defence submission that the proceedings should be stayed for an abuse of process

CLAIM sentence:  However, he also expressed the provisional view, not central to his principal conclusion in relation to the application of which he was formally seized, that the act of a police officer accessing the PNC and providing the information to a former colleague might not in the circumstances of this particular case amount to misconduct in public office, and in any event the matter was not terribly serious

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, following the judges comments, a number of case conferences took place with the CPS and prosecution counsel

CLAIM sentence:  With the judges comments in mind it was decided not to proceed on the basis that it would not be in the public interest given the potential costs that would be incurred

CLAIM sentence:  I do not comment on the judges expression of opinion (also reflected in the sentences which had been passed in relation to Operation Glade discussed below)

CLAIM sentence:  I do, however, add that whatever might have been the position considered by the judge and, in consequence, by the CPS in  should not be assumed to represent a current assessment of whether conduct of that type constitutes misconduct in public office or the gravity of such conduct

CLAIM sentence:  In evidence, DCS Middleton was asked why journalists were not within the scope of Operation Reproof

CLAIM sentence:  The whole inquiry right from the outset was extremely open, an open-minded approach as to what we would discover

CLAIM sentence:  In evidence he was asked whether there was any indirect or inferential evidence that a media organisation was involved

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Middleton responded: As Ive said right from the outset, the mindset of myself as the senior investigating officer and my team, who were thoroughly professional throughout, was we were open-minded as to what we would find and we would have dealt with that and pursued that based on information or evidence that we had

CLAIM sentence:  We deal with information, intelligence and evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The CPS were working alongside us, as were the Police Complaints Authority

CLAIM sentence:  We did not have anything that directly or indirectly linked to journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Had we done so, wed have thoroughly investigated that

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Motorman was commenced because an audit by Devon and Cornwall Police had identified that Paul Marshall, a civilian member of the police staff at Tooting police station, had been accessing the PNC and obtaining information for Steve Whittamore, a private investigator

CLAIM sentence:  A search warrant (executed with the Information Commissioners investigators present) at the latters premises demonstrated that he was involved in obtaining details of an individuals criminal history by way of a check through the Criminal Records Office (CRO) or details of his or her address by way of a check on the registered keeper of a vehicle

CLAIM sentence:  A large number of such checks were on behalf of the national press, where the information subsequently appeared

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence relating to Data Research Ltd was referred to the MPS, which first carried out a scoping exercise in order to decide whether the matter should formally be investigated

CLAIM sentence:  During the course of his evidence DCI Gilmour recognised that, when scoping the investigation, he and his colleagues were alive to the sensitivity of investigating journalists but said that he could not recall specific discussions about the issue

CLAIM sentence:  He expressly disavowed that the investigators were in fear of the press:  Well, considering the work that we were doing, investigating corrupt police employees, police officers and members of civilian staff, investigating journalists didnt present any fear

CLAIM sentence:  There wasnt any fear involved at all

CLAIM sentence:  But we did recognise the significance of what we were doing and the attention that that would attract and that would obviously shape how we approached that, but it certainly wouldnt have stopped us doing it and there was no trepidation around it

CLAIM sentence:  He also denied fearing a backlash from the press

CLAIM sentence:  DCI Gilmour was asked whether the resource implications of taking on journalists and powerful newspapers, who would have access to sophisticated legal advice, were a factor in their decision-making

CLAIM sentence:  His response was that such considerations would not have stopped the investigating team from doing what it needed to do

CLAIM sentence:  The terms of reference of Operation Glade were ultimately set down as follows:  To investigate (covertly) at this time the allegations against Marshall in order to prove or disprove his involvement in the offences alleged

CLAIM sentence:  There appears to be clear evidence that Marshall is conducting illegal PNC or CRO checks on behalf of John Boyall at the request of a number of reporters

CLAIM sentence:  The aim of the investigation will be to gather evidence of Marshall, Boyall and Whittamores involvement in the misuse of the PNC or CRO systems with a view to prosecuting them for any offences disclosed or to prevent further misuse

CLAIM sentence:  It is noteworthy that the terms of reference did not expressly encompass investigating the journalists who had received the information

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, however, it became clear that DCI Gilmour did not consider that this limited the extent of the investigation or prevented the investigators from turning their attention to those journalists at the appropriate time

CLAIM sentence:  He said: E The default isnt always to arrest in the first instance

CLAIM sentence:  My consideration then were what is it that I was hoping to achieve and what I wanted to achieve was to interview the journalists under caution

CLAIM sentence:  I, through the legal departments of the various newspapers, was able to access and secure the attendance of the journalists, and that was relatively straightforward, I think, without any complication

CLAIM sentence:  He also explained it was not necessary to arrest the journalists because, given the evidence in the ledgers that the journalists had requested the information, there was no need to carry out searches of the journalists premises (arrest carries with it certain powers of search under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act )

CLAIM sentence:  It is not without interest that this approach was not adopted in relation to Clive Goodman during the course of Operation Caryatid and neither is it necessarily accurate: in any case which is dependent on circumstantial evidence, whatever documentary evidence can be found is always likely to add weight (or detract) from the strength of the case

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, however, the legitimacy of different approaches by different officers must be accepted and there is no evidence or basis for suggesting an ulterior motive

CLAIM sentence:  Between  January  and  January , the police interviewed seven journalists under caution

CLAIM sentence:  As anticipated each attended voluntarily and was legally represented

CLAIM sentence:  DCI Gilmour said that a number of the journalists gave the account that they believed that the information was coming from the courts and that CRO stood for Court Record Office

CLAIM sentence:  DCI Gilmour said that it was specifically put to them that, by their very nature, details of convictions must have been obtained unlawfully

CLAIM sentence:  The journalists simply pleaded ignorance

CLAIM sentence:  The police sought the advice of the CPS as to the likelihood of successfully prosecuting all the suspects, including the journalists, and as to the appropriate charges

CLAIM sentence:  The CPS advised that Messrs Marshall, King, Boyall and Whittamore should be charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office

CLAIM sentence:  As regards the journalists, the CPS advised that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone because it was unlikely to be proved that there was the requisite degree of knowledge that the information was being unlawfully obtained

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has not investigated the reasons for this conclusion (which some may argue appears overcautious): the relationship between the CPS and the press has not been the subject of investigation

CLAIM sentence:  What can be said with certainty, however, is that this material does not provide any evidence that the failure to prosecute any of the journalists was influenced or motivated by any fear of the press on the part of the police, or by any improperly close relationship

CLAIM sentence:  A count of obtaining personal information contrary to s()(a) of the Data Protection Act  was later added to the indictment against Messrs Boyall and Whittamore

CLAIM sentence:  In May , the CPS sought counsels advice as to the merits of a reference under s of the Criminal Justice Act  to the Court of Appeal to challenge the sentences on the ground that they were unduly lenient

CLAIM sentence:   p, lines -, DCI Gilmour, ibid  For my part, it seems remarkable that notwithstanding all that has been written about criminal records over the years, the journalists all misunderstood the meaning of the acronym CRO or believed that a search of court records could have been accomplished within the time of the response

CLAIM sentence:  That said, I am not suggesting that the advice of the CPS, on which the police were bound to act, was based on anything other than an objective and independent minded assessment of the strength of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction The information arising from Operation Reproof caused the Office of the Information Commissioner (ICO) to focus attention on Steve Whittamore

CLAIM sentence:  They seized a significant volume of documentation detailing an extensive trade in personal information

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately, the implications of this material were of sufficient significance that the ICO was prompted to lay before Parliament two reports setting out a summary of the evidence obtained as part of the investigation: What Price Privacy? and What Price Privacy Now? The reports also called for stricter penalties for those engaged in unlawful activities, in particular for breach of s of the Data Protection Act  (DPA)

CLAIM sentence:  This provision makes it an offence to obtain, disclose or procure the disclosure of confidential personal information, knowingly or recklessly, without the consent of the organisation holding the data

CLAIM sentence:  This chapter explores the essential narrative surrounding this investigation and the evidence obtained during Operation Motorman

CLAIM sentence: \t The\tgenesis\tof\tOperation\tMotorman 

CLAIM sentence:  The documents recorded the owners details alongside the VRMs and also contained times and dates when the searches had been carried out

CLAIM sentence:  This included reports, workbooks, ledgers, invoices and in particular four hardback coloured notebooks which have become known as the Blue book, Red book, Green book and Yellow book

CLAIM sentence:  On   Information Commissioners Office, What Price Privacy?, p, para 

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Information Commissioners Office, What Price Privacy?, p, para 

CLAIM sentence:  The highly confidential nature of the information contained within the database, and the need to protect the privacy of the subjects of the information requested, requires the confidentiality of the details of the database to be preserved and the subjects of the requests to remain anonymous

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, the journalists who are identified by name in the database, but have not been interviewed or prosecuted by the ICO, have not been named during the course of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  I heard submissions in private as to how to use this material and decided to make the database available to the Core Participants of the Inquiry, subject to confidentiality undertakings and on strict conditions

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of making the material available was to permit Core Participants to evaluate their position in relation to this evidence

CLAIM sentence:  In due course it was conceded by all Core Participants that I could proceed on the basis that no positive case was to be mounted by them that the Motorman material did not reveal prima facie evidence of breaches by journalists of the DPA, and I have done so

CLAIM sentence:  It has not been suggested by any Core Participant that, if necessary, I cannot go further and reach my own conclusions based on the Motorman evidence as to the culture, practices and ethics of the press

CLAIM sentence:  These requests principally related to activities in the period between the end of  and  March  when the material was seized by the ICO; however the earliest entry was around 

CLAIM sentence:  Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner at the time, gave evidence that the total number of requests was ,

CLAIM sentence:  Associated Newspapers Ltd later confirmed that it did not advance a positive case contradicting the position that there exists prima facie evidence that journalists did act in breach of s by obtaining information which, prima facie, could not be justified in the public interest

CLAIM sentence: pdf; p, Richard Thomas, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The demand for this information from the press was constant

CLAIM sentence:  Buyers/customers of information It is important to acknowledge that the buyers or customers of the information were not, by any means, exclusively journalists

CLAIM sentence:  They included the media, insurance companies, lenders and creditors, parties involved in family disputes, criminals with what are likely to have been criminal or malicious intentions, including witness and juror intimidation, and estranged couples seeking details of their partners whereabouts

CLAIM sentence:  The Parliamentary Report, What Price Privacy Now?, identified  journalists as having been named in the Motorman documents, as set out in the table below

CLAIM sentence:  One example of a method used to obtain information is illustrated by BT ex-directory numbers

CLAIM sentence:  Subjects of requests for information Turning to the journalists, the information sought related, in part, to a number of well-known celebrities and other figures in the public-eye, but equally included individuals who were only remotely connected with public figures, and some who had no obvious newsworthiness at all; one, for example was a self-employed painter and decorator who had once worked for a lottery winner

CLAIM sentence:  I emphasise immediately that at least some of this information could have been obtained lawfully, but that is not the case for all the types of information sought

CLAIM sentence:  The price for obtaining this type of information was -

CLAIM sentence:  These examples demonstrate that whilst some requests were more general, such as seeking to identify where an individual lived, other requests were highly specific in their terms

CLAIM sentence:  Methods of obtaining information 

CLAIM sentence:  Within the types of information requested, varying methods were used to obtain the data

CLAIM sentence:  He further explained that criminal records checks could also not be obtained lawfully

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, in relation to obtaining the vehicle owners details from the DVLA, this information could only be obtained lawfully in a number of specifically defined circumstances set out by law

CLAIM sentence:  The DVLAs vehicle register holds information about each motor vehicle  p, lines -, Alexander Owens, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  registration mark, vehicle identification number, make/model, emissions, etc) and includes the name and address of the registered keeper, dates of acquisition and disposal, and the vehicles tax status

CLAIM sentence:  The driver register holds each drivers name, address, date of birth, photograph, endorsements, convictions and relevant medical information that may affect a persons ability to drive

CLAIM sentence:  It may also be made available to a person who has reasonable cause for seeking particulars, for example following involvement in an accident, enforcement of road traffic legislation or tax collection

CLAIM sentence:  It appears very unlikely that requests made to the DVLA for owners addresses to be supplied to journalists would fall within this category

CLAIM sentence:  It is right to observe that, in principle, other forms of information, for example addresses, or ex-directory numbers, may be obtained through lawful means

CLAIM sentence:  For example, one can conceive of a laborious check of the full electoral register to identify an address

CLAIM sentence:  Public interest In his evidence Mr Thomas acknowledged that there could, at least in theory, be cases where the public interest fully justified obtaining personal data (with the result that no offence would be committed); and he also recognised that there could be questions concerning proof of intention or recklessness

CLAIM sentence:  He explained, I havent seen a whiff of public interest

CLAIM sentence:  It was tittle-tattle

CLAIM sentence:  It was fishing

CLAIM sentence:  Given that no journalists were ever interviewed by the ICO in relation to Operation Motorman, the strength of any public interest defence is difficult to assess definitively and I do not propose to do so

CLAIM sentence:  However, it was suggested to the Inquiry by at least one press Core Participant that the newspaper required access to this data in order to be able to contact the subject of a story for his or her version of events; in other words, to facilitate the exercise of a right to reply

CLAIM sentence:  Expressed in these terms, a public interest defence has superficial attraction, but upon closer analysis its strength dissipates

CLAIM sentence:  In each case consideration needs to be given to the subject matter of the story which is proposed to be published

CLAIM sentence:  If the story has a potential freestanding public interest, then it is indeed arguable that, subject to a range of other factors, the journalist might need to contact the subject of the story for his or her account

CLAIM sentence:  But if, as Mr Thomas has suggested, there is not a whiff of public interest in the underlying story, it is not arguable that a public interest can be manufactured for the purposes of the defence under s of the DPA on the grounds that the subject needs to be contacted

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, regard must be paid to the nature of the information commonly being sought by journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Even more difficult is to see the public interest in deceptively obtaining a criminal record check

CLAIM sentence:  Again, the fact that no journalist was ever interviewed by the ICO renders difficult an assessment of whether this mental element could have been proved

CLAIM sentence:  It is, of course, possible to draw certain inferences from the available material

CLAIM sentence:  That material includes, in particular, the type of data sought and obtained, the speed with which it was obtained, the amount of money paid for the information in question, and the sheer quantity of requests

CLAIM sentence:  In that regard, I do no more than accept the concession that the press Core Participants made to that effect

CLAIM sentence:  It is not possible to go further than that, and (notwithstanding that the names of the journalists have not entered the public domain) it would be unfair to do so

CLAIM sentence: \t Prosecutions\tarising\tfrom\tOperation\tMotorman 

CLAIM sentence:  However, the evidence obtained by the ICO overlapped to some extent with the material obtained by the MPS and therefore the prosecutions led by the CPS in relation to the offences of corruption and conspiracy were given priority, being offences of a more serious nature

CLAIM sentence:   incidents were covered by the indictment,  in respect of Criminal Record Office offences and seven in relation to vehicle checks from the PNC

CLAIM sentence:  HHJ Samuels QC stated that: the vice of the primary conspiracy was to make known to the press information which on any view ought to have been confidential, and was bound at its lowest to cause immense embarrassment to members of the public who required the state to maintain confidentiality in their affairs

CLAIM sentence:  The reasons for the discontinuance of the prosecutions are identified in the report What Price Privacy?; namely that the ICO was disappointed at the sentences imposed by the court and considered that it was not in the public interest to proceed with the ICOs own prosecutions in these  pp-, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///First-Witness-Statement-of- Richard-Thomas-CBE

CLAIM sentence:  Given that the maximum sentence for a breach of s was a financial penalty, it cannot be said that this decision was unrealistic

CLAIM sentence: \t Publication\tof\tParliamentary\tReports\tin\t 

CLAIM sentence:  The report What Price Privacy? The unlawful trade in confidential personal information was published on  May  and the follow-up report What Price Privacy Now? was published on  December 

CLAIM sentence:  What Price Privacy? The Parliamentary Report published in May  was not the first occasion on which the issue of the unlawful trade in personal information had been debated or discussed in public

CLAIM sentence:  The report also noted that the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport had conducted an investigation in early  into privacy and media intrusion and concluded in its reports that improper and intrusive gathering of data had appeared in the press and that these methods amounted to a depressing catalogue of deplorable practices

CLAIM sentence:  The first report laid before Parliament claimed to reveal evidence of systematic breaches of privacy that amounted to an unlawful trade of confidential personal information

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of the report was to put a stop to the trade by proposing the introduction of a custodial sentence for up to two years for persons convicted on indictment, or six months for summary convictions

CLAIM sentence:  Section  of What Price Privacy? set out the evidence collated by the ICO which illustrated the market in the unlawful supply of personal data

CLAIM sentence:  Case details provided evidence of who is buying the information and why, and who is obtaining and supplying the information

CLAIM sentence:  We also have some idea of how the suppliers operate and the prices they charge

CLAIM sentence:   Information Commissioners Office, What Price Privacy?, p, para 

CLAIM sentence: , ibid  Chapter  | Operation MotormanE\xc

CLAIM sentence:  secondary documentation consisted of the detectives own handwritten personal notes and a record of work carried out, about whom and for whom

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to methods, the report set out that there were two principal methods of obtaining information: corruption and deception

CLAIM sentence:  Corrupt practices included paying employees of organisations, for example the DVLA, to access information available to them by virtue of their position, whilst deceptive practices included impersonating either the data subject or a third party (for example an employee of the same organisation) to obtain the information

CLAIM sentence:  The report also identified in broad terms a number of individuals who had been interviewed as part of the investigation, including celebrities, professional footballers and managers, broadcasters, a member of the Royal Household and also figures of less obvious public interest, including the sister of a partner of a local politician

CLAIM sentence:  The report set out the example of a mother whose show-business daughter had featured in a number of press stories

CLAIM sentence:  Further, a number of those interviewed reported media intrusion after personal information had been passed to the press and all were confident that they had not willingly supplied the information nor consented to its release

CLAIM sentence:  Another aspect of the transactions that was analysed in the report was the issue of cost; that is to say how much the ultimate customers were charged for personal information and how much of this was profit once the agent sourcing the information had been paid

CLAIM sentence:  for finding an address for a person on the electoral roll, to about  to search for an ex-directory number, and up to  for a criminal record check and  to obtain mobile account details

CLAIM sentence:  It seems likely that the figures reflected the mode of obtaining the information sought, in particular where other parties, for example blaggers, or employees, required payment for their role in the provision of the information

CLAIM sentence:  In the conclusion of the report, the ICO made a number of extremely pertinent observations: At a time when senior members of the press were publicly congratulating themselves for having raised journalistic standards across the industry, many newspapers were continuing to subscribe to an undercover economy devoted to obtaining a wealth of personal information forbidden to them by law

CLAIM sentence:  it is framed in a way that applies to those who request the disclosure of personal data and those who supply it, including any intermediaries in the chain

CLAIM sentence:   p, paras 

CLAIM sentence: , ibid  p, paras 

CLAIM sentence:  The ICO sought custodial sentences in relation to the commission of offences under s DPA in order to deter this unlawful trade in information

CLAIM sentence:  The ways in which the ICO sought to achieve that end are dealt with in Part H of the Report

CLAIM sentence:  The Parliamentary Report What Price Privacy Now? was published to chart the progress in the six months following the first report and to set out the responses to the recommendations set out in the first report

CLAIM sentence:  The report noted that a Freedom of Information Act request for further information about the  journalists identified in the Motorman material and referred to in What Price Privacy? had been considered and, on the basis that disclosure of the information was in the public interest, the employers of the journalists were set out in tabular form

CLAIM sentence:  It is worth underlining the view of the Information Commissioner, as set out in the text of What Price Privacy Now?, that the figures in the table do not purport to set out the total number of offences committed by journalists, but rather the number of requests made by journalists for information

CLAIM sentence:  Second, the numbers of individual journalists engaged in purchasing personal information from particular titles is higher than could be put down to certain individuals undertaking investigations which might or might not have been known about or authorised

CLAIM sentence:  Where dozens, or in some cases, over  journalists at a particular title have sought to purchase personal information, the inference that these practices were endemic within particular titles may be readily understood

CLAIM sentence:  A number of the requests in this category included PNC requests, friends and family requests and some ex-directory requests

CLAIM sentence:  The ICO considered that the obtaining of this information was likely to amount to breaches of the DPA; however, the nature of the transactions was not sufficiently known or understood for these to be characterised as a positive breach of the DPA, rather than probably illicit transactions

CLAIM sentence:  Some , of the transactions were considered to lack sufficient identification or understanding of how the information had been obtained to determine whether they represented illicit transactions

CLAIM sentence:  above: a detailed examination of many individual examples would, in my judgment, undeniably have established that this was the very lowest at which it could be put

CLAIM sentence:  Without condemning any journalist (none of whom were ever even interviewed by the ICO), it is sufficient for me to conclude that, at least in part, what has been revealed by some of the Operation Motorman evidence demonstrates an attitude to compliance with the law relating to data protection which can only be described as cavalier, if not worse: it is certainly revealing of what, at that time at least, were the practices of parts of the press

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, however, there was also increasing public concern about the apparent lack of appropriate investigation by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) into the conduct of a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, and the extent of the involvement of the NoTW (precipitated by increasing disclosure arising out of civil litigation)

CLAIM sentence:  The consequence (prior to the disclosures about Milly Dowler) was that the then Acting Commissioner, Tim Godwin, had re-opened the investigation into the NoTW which had started in ; substantial resources were devoted to it

CLAIM sentence:  Not the least important reason for this concern was the increasingly vocal allegation that the relationship between senior executives at the NoTW and senior officers at the MPS had influenced or affected the direction of the investigation; the allegation itself had the potential to cause serious damage to the reputation of the police generally

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore not surprising that the Terms of Reference for Part  of the Inquiry specifically require it to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press including contacts with, and the relationship between, the press and the police along with the conduct of each

CLAIM sentence:  They also require recommendations as to how future concerns about press behaviour should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities, including the police, the prosecuting and regulatory authorities and Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  On the other side of the same investigation, it is also necessary to consider (as part of the culture, practices and ethics of the press) the response to the police investigation of NI, the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), and the Culture, Media and Sports Committee and the Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons

CLAIM sentence:  The part played by the PCC also deserves detailed consideration in the context of a consideration of the effectiveness of any new regulatory regime

CLAIM sentence:  That is because I must address the allegation that the MPS deliberately held back on a full investigation (and further investigation in  and ) because of a link with NI

CLAIM sentence:  In my ruling of  May  in relation to the operation of rule  of the Inquiry Rules  to the MPS, I said: If not because of the influence of the press, why did the police not go further with Operation Caryatid or investigate the Mulcaire notebook in more detail (particularly as a number of officers were concerned that it more than justified further examination)? Why was it that the articles in The Guardian and the New York Times were so quickly dismissed without further investigation being undertaken? In my judgment, answering those questions would be a critical part of the exercise both to assuage the legitimate public concern that caused the conduct of the police to be included in the Inquiry in the first place but also to justify any conclusions that I reach as to future conduct of the relationship between press and police

CLAIM sentence:  I concluded that answering these questions could give rise to criticism and I decided to approach the MPS, individual police officers, the CPS and counsel on that basis

CLAIM sentence:  Given that the statements of a number of police officers used for the Inquiry were those prepared for other proceedings, therefore, it is not surprising that, in response to notices under rule , additional material has been forthcoming

CLAIM sentence:  I have dealt with it in the Report and directed that additional statements, establishing the facts put before me, should be provided and treated as part of the evidence of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Where new issues have arisen, I have identified them but, in fairness, declined to determine any such issue adverse to any individual: to do otherwise would have been to require further rule  notices if not further oral hearings

CLAIM sentence:  The complaint In December , the Royal Household reported to the Royalty Protection Department of the MPS that it was concerned that the voicemail messages of Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and Helen Asprey, respectively the private and personal secretaries to Princes William and Harry, were the subject of unlawful interception

CLAIM sentence:  Information had been appearing in the press, in particular in the column of Clive Goodman, the Royal editor at the NoTW, which suggested knowledge of the content of voicemail messages left on their mobile phones

CLAIM sentence:  For the sake of clarity, the Report refers to them throughout by the rank which they held at the time they gave evidence rather than the (sometimes different) ranks that they held at the various times of their involvement in the investigation or may hold at the time of publication of the Report  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  As standard practice, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees kept a decision log and prepared written case reviews

CLAIM sentence:  In these contemporaneous documents, the officers recorded key decisions about the case including their thoughts about the investigation, the details of periodic reviews and their requests for advice from the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  In contrast with the standard practice adopted elsewhere in this Report, this Chapter refers to certain documents which are not on the Inquiry website or otherwise in the public domain

CLAIM sentence:  Although each has been closely examined during the course of the Inquiry, therefore, hyperlinked references to these documents cannot be provided

CLAIM sentence: \t The\tcollection\tof\tevidence The covert phase 

CLAIM sentence:  They could not, for instance, determine whether a voicemail message (whether new or old) existed within a voicemail box at any particular time

CLAIM sentence:  Although it was possible to identify outside or potential rogue numbers dialling into a persons voicemail box, the available software could not identify whether or not the rogue number had listened to any messages

CLAIM sentence:  They also could not assist with how often the illegal access was taking place or how widespread it was

CLAIM sentence:  It is appropriate to note that he was: at pains to ensure that no one company was singled out as being particularly at risk/fault because to an extent, we only knew what we knew from those companies who had software that could give an indication of potential interception

CLAIM sentence:  Despite acknowledging how widespread the practice was likely to be, DCS Williams maintained the focus of the investigation on the Royal Household (not least because the enquiry was still in its early stages) with a view to establishing whether what the police had discovered was a one-off set of occurrences or something more systematic

CLAIM sentence:  Rather than use one or more acronyms, they will be referred to generically as unique voicemail access numbers  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The first of the two offences about which the police sought advice was unauthorised access to computer material contrary to s of the Computer Misuse Act  (CMA); this is a summary only offence attracting a maximum six months imprisonment

CLAIM sentence:  S()(b) of RIPA makes it a criminal offence for a person intentionally and without lawful authority to intercept, at any place in the United Kingdom, any communication in the course of its transmission by means of a public telecommunication system

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams also set out in the review his understanding that the s of RIPA offence would not be committed unless the interception took place before the intended recipient had listened to the message

CLAIM sentence:  This has been referred to during the Inquiry by reference to the analogy of an unopened envelope and as the narrow interpretation (the wide interpretation, in contrast, being that the timing of the interception would be immaterial to the commission of the offence so that it would not matter whether or not the intended recipient or anyone else entitled to access the voicemail system had done so)

CLAIM sentence:  He noted that the practice of voicemail interception: 

CLAIM sentence:  was highly unlikely to be limited to Goodman alone and is probably quite widespread amongst those who would be interested in such access a much wider security issue within the UK and potentially worldwide

CLAIM sentence:  This case review also demonstrated that, at this early stage, DCS Williams was concerned about the pressure on resources

CLAIM sentence:  He recorded that: taking this inquiry forward will impact on core SO operations and the resource implications for a prosecution could be significant

CLAIM sentence:  The resource implications referred to by DCS Williams in the context of core operations conducted by SO need hardly be made explicit

CLAIM sentence:  The terrorist threat in  remained at the highest level and must legitimately have been assessed as being at a totally different order of priority to voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  At the same time, however, the need to keep the investigation secret and the need to maintain the confidence of the Royal Family was militating against transferring the investigation out of SO

CLAIM sentence:  By  April  nine potential victims within the Royal Household had been identified

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams decided that only six of them would be notified that they were potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams therefore asked for and obtained additional investigative resources

CLAIM sentence:  He put it in his the statement (prepared for judicial review proceedings against the MPS) that: In terms of securing the confidence and willingness for any victims to be willing to give evidence in court my strategy was to try to prove the offences based on technical evidence rather than bringing into a public arena who might have been leaving messages for whom and almost inevitably, what the content of any message might be by way of proof it existed

CLAIM sentence:  Equally I wanted to be able to present the case in a clear and concise manner to ensure the best chance of a successful prosecution and thereafter provide the greatest sentencing powers

CLAIM sentence:  In short, DCS Williams was anxious to ensure that the prosecution could be ring-fenced so as to avoid any member of the Royal Family being placed in the potentially embarrassing position of giving evidence and to avoid the examination of the actual content of any of the intercepted voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  In other words, he wished to confine the evidence for the prosecution to witness evidence from members of staff within the Royal Household (as opposed to members of the Royal Family) and to technical data relating to the interceptions

CLAIM sentence:  It is not correct to interpret the use by DCS Williams of the term ring-fence as an intention or attempt to rule out the investigation of other potential victims

CLAIM sentence: pdf;  Decision log dated  April  (not published)  para 

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees recalled specifically the use of the analogy of the unopened envelope

CLAIM sentence:  They also raised the strategic and presentational question of whether the prosecution could be ring- fenced in the manner described in the paragraph above

CLAIM sentence:  She put it in this way:  the offences under Section  of RIPA, would as far as I can see only relate to such messages that had not been previously accessed by the recipient

CLAIM sentence:  However, this area is very much untested and further consideration will need to be given to this

CLAIM sentence:  Again, the actual technical evidence would need to be carefully considered before any firm view could be taken about whether the offence is capable of being proved

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Dowd also advised that the prosecution could be ring-fenced in order to avoid the need for a member of the Royal Family to give evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, it is correct to point out that in the context of this preliminary advice Ms Dowd did not mention the possibility of charging the inchoate offence of conspiracy under the Criminal Law Act , or the consequences of relying on an agreement to intercept messages which would not require proof of an unopened envelope

CLAIM sentence:  There is no sensible basis for suggesting that this provisional legal advice, given by Ms Dowd, on the interpretation of s of RIPA was influenced by any concern about offending NI and I have no doubt that it was not

CLAIM sentence:  The fact that her initial view as to the proper interpretation of s RIPA may not have been right therefore throws no light on the conduct of the police and the press

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is important to consider whether the fact that this initial view was provided goes some way to explaining the apparent restraint shown by the MPS in limiting the scope of the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  This preliminary advice certainly led DCS Williams to direct the investigation towards obtaining technical evidence that the suspect was accessing voicemail messages before the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  In the words of DCS Williams: This was my understanding of the law from the beginning of the enquiry, it was a key question put to the CPS which they confirmed as being correct and thereafter it was central to all our activity in terms of securing best evidence including the use of an expert witness

CLAIM sentence:  If at any time the advice had been otherwise I would not have had  paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  pdf; paras , , , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  It goes further because it would have been irresponsible to ignore it, the risk being that, unless the allegation of conspiracy was brought into play, they would fall at the first hurdle of any prosecution under s of RIPA should the court subsequently conclude that this narrow interpretation was correct without there being evidence that the envelope had been unopened when accessed by the accused

CLAIM sentence:  Although the CPS had been careful to advise that the CMA was an alternative statutory recourse, if the police wished to keep both legal avenues open in line with CPS advice it was necessary to obtain this specific evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Simply as a matter of chronology, it is worth noting that, on  April , Andy Hayman met Andy Coulson and Neil Wallis (then Editor and Deputy Editor of NoTW) with Dick Fedorcio

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, although I understand why it is contended that the contrary cannot be excluded, I am satisfied that the police did nothing to alert the editors as to what was going on: it does, however, serve to underline the importance of care in relation to contacts with any organisation an employee of which is being investigated simply because of the perception that favours could be exchanged

CLAIM sentence:  In the course of its own internal enquiry O had traced audio recordings of a man calling himself Paul Williams phoning O customer services and asking for pin numbers for voicemail accounts to be re-set to default settings

CLAIM sentence:  He held himself out as an O employee who was authorised to have access to customer information and to make such requests

CLAIM sentence:  O discovered that on two occasions Paul Williams asked for Ms Aspreys pin number to be reset to default, and that this had been carried out

CLAIM sentence: pdf;  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcthe public through unauthorised access to voicemail

CLAIM sentence:  The Goodman connection is potentially an example of this, but the more sinister side would be that the knowledge could equally be utilised by criminals whether that be in the general sense, for terrorism or to threaten national security

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore I believe that this matter has a significant public interest aspect to it particularly in terms of safety and security and risk to life

CLAIM sentence:  With DCS Williams working abroad between  May and  June , DCS Surtees oversaw this aspect of the operation the aim of which was to prove who was accessing messages and to obtain evidence to establish that after a voicemail message had been left, the same message was illicitly accessed before it was heard by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  It transpired that it was only through Vodafones Vampire data that the police could definitively prove the sequence of person A leaving a message on person Bs voicemail and person C dialling in and retrieving the message

CLAIM sentence:  In the process of monitoring the systems, it captured data relating to customers accounts, including when a voicemail message was left and when it was opened

CLAIM sentence:  However, this data was not retained for very long and so Vodafone needed to harvest it on a regular basis

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly had the impression that it would only exist for a matter of days or maybe a couple of weeks

CLAIM sentence:  On  May  O informed the police that they had identified and contacted a number of customers whose voicemail accounts had potentially been accessed unlawfully

CLAIM sentence:  Two such customers, Max Clifford and HJK had asked that the police be informed

CLAIM sentence:  On  May  Ms Dowd prepared a briefing on the current status of the investigation for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who at that time was Ken Macdonald QC (now Lord Macdonald QC of River Glaven), and for the Attorney General

CLAIM sentence:  This was conventional in any case involving members of the Royal Family

CLAIM sentence:  A number of the targets of these unauthorised accesses have been informed some of whom have declined to assist in a police investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He was not asked to give an opinion on the case and he said it would have been surprising if he had been asked to do so

CLAIM sentence:  Pursuing his recommendation that the wider investigation should be undertaken by a different team, he also recorded that he had briefed the relevant officers

CLAIM sentence:  His evidence was that, when it was becoming clear that the police were looking at something endemic within a particular part of the media and that there were more victims than they originally thought, he did seriously consider transferring the investigation from SO to a different department

CLAIM sentence:  He described this as a moment of reflection during which he put the operation in its context

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams concluded by setting out his concerns about the strain on resources caused by the burgeoning number of SO anti-terrorist operations and the need, given the limited resources available, for a proportionate approach to Operation Caryatid: At the moment I consider that I have enough resources to continue with this enquiry in terms of what is currently required, however I believe that it is important to formally record that this investigation has been conducted against a backdrop of sustained and increasing workload for SO since at least December 

CLAIM sentence:  This has resulted in some lower priority anti terrorist operations being placed on hold to release officers to higher priority operations

CLAIM sentence:  The level of the current workload is unprecedented and the assessment for the future is that this is unlikely to ease

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Caryatid has been brought to its current status against this backdrop and the need to balance resources against all anti terrorist operations

CLAIM sentence:  arrest/ searches will need to be balanced against the whole of SO/CT priorities

CLAIM sentence:  These comments are documented purely to reinforce how my decision-making has been reached in terms of how to approach this enquiry in a proportionate manner

CLAIM sentence:  In the context of what was later to happen (both at the conclusion of the prosecution and during the years that followed  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  interceptions before the voicemail message had been listened to by its intended recipient  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  On  July , before the CPS responded to this request for advice from the police, Ms Dowd sent another confidential briefing note to the DPP and the Attorney General

CLAIM sentence:  She also stated that: Whilst there are many aspects of the evidence which I would require to be clarified, it is my initial assessment that offences under the CMA and RIPA  may be provable

CLAIM sentence:  However, in addition, I would also be looking to consider an offence of conspiracy to commit those offences on the basis of other evidence being available 

CLAIM sentence:  It is correct to observe that this was the first occasion on which the possibility of the criminality being accommodated within the offence of conspiracy was mentioned by the CPS

CLAIM sentence: pdf; Letter of advice not published  pp-, Lord Macdonald QC, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Also on  July  DCS Williams prepared a further written update on the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  It would also require significant SO resources and the current terrorist threat requires their deployment elsewhere against much higher threats to public safety/life

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams also had in mind that including more victims would be unlikely to increase significantly the sentence that the offenders would receive; and that securing a conviction as a deterrent to others would be best achieved through a clear and simple case

CLAIM sentence:  He set out that the alternative to limiting Operation Caryatid would be: a much extended trial, numerous victims [sic], potentially more suspects with a host of council [sic] all seeking to derail what could appear to be a far more complicated case 

CLAIM sentence:  In the same update of  July , DCS Williams also listed the factors which influenced his view that the investigation should not be transferred out of SO

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees then noted in the decision log: As a result the position is that this changes the perception that as well as the Royal Correspondent of the N

CLAIM sentence: W filling up his editorial with Royal gossip the potential for operational Security breaches now not only surrounds the Royal household but also Cabinet Ministers

CLAIM sentence:  When giving evidence, DCS Surtees agreed that his primary concern was then to stop the voicemail interception in the interests of national security

CLAIM sentence:  On  August  Ms Dowd discussed the case with leading counsel, David Perry QC

CLAIM sentence:  The only record that exists of the meeting on  August  is an email sent by Ms Dowd to the police on that day

CLAIM sentence:  On the question of the interpretation of s of RIPA, Ms Dowd said the following in the email: We have briefly discussed before the possibility of arguing that what we have termed our Computer Misuse Act offences might fall to be considered as RIPA offences that the issue has not definitively been argued

CLAIM sentence:  I was reticent about arguing the point in this case

CLAIM sentence:  As regards Ms Dowds use of the words if not more I hear, DCS Surtees was asked whether this was a reference to the possibility, at least, of additional co-conspirators

CLAIM sentence:  Pausing in the narrative, it is appropriate to comment on the approach of the police to the gathering of evidence and to the strategic decisions that were taken, particularly against the context of the concern that this approach was or could have been affected by the relationship between the MPS or its most senior officers and NI

CLAIM sentence:  The first point to make is that there is no evidence (or even the slightest suggestion) of any relationship between NI, the NoTW or any of its employees and any officers involved in this enquiry from the Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Mr Clarke) down through the detective ranks

CLAIM sentence:  To the best of his knowledge he had never met or even spoken to Neil Wallis or Colin Myler (editor of the NoTW between the end of January  and July )

CLAIM sentence:  He met Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson on one occasion in 

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of that meeting was to make the media aware of the reality of the terrorist threat because there had been a great deal of criticism in the media of the counter-terrorism effort and some commentators had been saying that the terrorist threat was being exaggerated by the authorities for political or self- serving purposes

CLAIM sentence:  The contemporaneous decision logs and case reviews identify this reasoning; DCS Williams spoke of the process as involving a balance of risk and harm which would be judged in particular against the imminence of a threat to life and it is equally clear that judgements continued to be made throughout this time on that basis

CLAIM sentence:  Such a decision, however, does leave open the need to devise, institute and execute an appropriate exit strategy

CLAIM sentence:  All these decisions were re-visited after the operation moved through the arrest and prosecution phases and require re-examination as the extent of the evidence came to be known whereupon the need for an exit strategy to deal with the unresolved issues surrounding the investigation became all the more pressing

CLAIM sentence:  The objectives of the search included looking for evidence implicating other NoTW journalists

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees explained: The intention behind searching the offices of News Corporation was to seize all material relating to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to establish the extent of their unlawful practises [sic] and also to establish the level of knowledge of NOTW concerning this illegal activity

CLAIM sentence:  Despite the legislative challenges to searching journalistic premises, the warrant would be executed as I was eager to gain entry to the offices of NOTW for two reasons: The first was to seek and recover any additional evidence relevant to Clive Goodmans activities and the second was to ascertain whether any other evidence existed implicating others within the NOTW in a wider conspiracy, hence my reference on application for the section  PACE warrant to the financial office

CLAIM sentence:  We got to the desk of Goodman, we seized some material from the desk of Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  There was a safe on his desk, which was unopened

CLAIM sentence:  They were asked to go to a conference room until lawyers could arrive to challenge the illegality of the section () and () and section  PACE authorities, and it was described to me as a tense stand-off by the officer leading the search

CLAIM sentence:  The officer tried to get our forensic management team, our search officers into the building

CLAIM sentence:  Our officers were effectively surrounded and photographed and not assisted in any way, shape or form

CLAIM sentence:  That search was curtailed

CLAIM sentence:  The search did not go to the extent I wanted it to

CLAIM sentence:  The financial records were not searched

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees explained: I think the moment had been lost with regard to the information we sought

CLAIM sentence:  He agreed that what he meant was that NI might have hidden or destroyed incriminating information

CLAIM sentence:  This is a disturbing conclusion and justifies a re-evaluation of the way in which PACE operates when seeking to deal with allegations of criminal conduct by journalists while at the same time protecting the essential requirements of a free press

CLAIM sentence:  Additionally, of potential importance was a first name in the top left hand corner of the page

CLAIM sentence:  Given the present status of the investigation and prosecution of journalists in relation to this material, it is not appropriate to go further

CLAIM sentence:  What can be added is that the , pages of documents included what has since been described as the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  The message read: Hello, This is the transcript for Neville

CLAIM sentence:  I have copied the text in the below email, and also attached the file as a word document

CLAIM sentence:  On the day of the arrests, the MPS notified the public that there were victims other than those associated with the Royal Household

CLAIM sentence:  Its press release stated that: As a result of their enquiries police now believe that figures beyond the Royal Household have had their telephones intercepted   Not published  This email was not ultimately used in support of the prosecution, instead forming part of the unused material

CLAIM sentence:  Unused material comprises documents gathered or created during an investigation but which the prosecution do not rely on in support of the charges; it must be disclosed to the defence if it undermines the case for the prosecution or might assist the case for the defence  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Lord-Reid

CLAIM sentence:  Following the arrests, NI instructed BCL Burton Copeland Solicitors (Burton Copeland) to respond on their behalf to any enquiries or requests from the police

CLAIM sentence:  David Mills is written underneath and it says husband and gives a telephone number for him and then (INAUDIBLE) refer to another document found in the kitchen cupboard of your home, exhibit WAB/ is another sheet of A paper which also refers to Tessa Jowell and that has a telephone number there

CLAIM sentence:  Now that sounds to me, that reads to me like youve written down somebodys conversation

CLAIM sentence:  DC Gallagher also asked the following question, which made clear that the police had evidence to suggest that Lord Prescott had been the victim of voicemail interception:  p, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Theres another name underneath, first of all it says advisor and then the name Joan Hammel

CLAIM sentence:  Youve got her telephone numbers and DM numbers, password numbers and Vodafone passwords that Ive already mentioned and an address in NW

CLAIM sentence:  Have you got that information to access John Prescotts network or that of his advisors? 

CLAIM sentence:  Weve got pages and pages of information here, at least another  odd pages, various names

CLAIM sentence:  I just picked out ones which are relevant to this enquiry that we put to you so far

CLAIM sentence:  Okay, the last page in this document is an email message

CLAIM sentence:  I hadnt seen that email at the time and that supports what I said earlier on, remind you that you were being paid by them a fixed fee just to do regular for them at their behest

CLAIM sentence:  Critical context for this development in the investigation comes from other arrests which took place on the same day as part of an investigation, Operation Overt

CLAIM sentence:  In short,  people were arrested for conspiracy to cause nine passenger aeroplanes to explode over the Atlantic; this was one of the largest counter terrorism operations ever undertaken

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcmaterial that had been found but it is highly material to bear in mind that, from that time, Operation Overt was also occupying his attention

CLAIM sentence:  The police have access to a computerised system to record the largest investigations and for the analysis of the material received

CLAIM sentence:  In evidence, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees gave different reasons for this decision

CLAIM sentence:  In order to have the material analysed in more detail DCS Surtees had to negotiate for the necessary resources

CLAIM sentence:  Because his anti-terrorism colleagues were all working on Operation Overt, DCS Surtees asked for some - officers from Special Branch: to populate a spread sheet with the details of all those individuals who appear on the documents seized that there is an indication of Interception offences against them

CLAIM sentence:  They began work on  August 

CLAIM sentence:  There is also a number of electronic media seized including cassette tapes, microtapes and computers 

CLAIM sentence:  Again whilst it would be advantageous to victims to be informed I would not be in a position to provide details and therefore would need to follow up each contact with further contact and conversations which by sheer volume would be impracticable

CLAIM sentence:  So in some cases the spread sheet will simply feature the name with no other information apparent in others then many other boxes will be populated

CLAIM sentence:  Before passing from this logged decision, it is important to note that DCS Surtees also recorded that the present advice from the CPS was that there needed to be evidence that the voicemail message was intercepted prior to being listened to by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, the advice of David Perry QC (that the wider interpretation of s of RIPA which avoided having to prove that the envelope had not been opened was arguably correct and that, in any event, the problems of interpretation could be wholly avoided by charging with conspiracy to commit the RIPA offence) had simply not filtered down to DCS Surtees

CLAIM sentence:  He continued to proceed on the basis of a far more restrictive interpretation of the law

CLAIM sentence:  The spreadsheet required by DCS Surtees took officers from Special Branch five to seven days (including overtime over a weekend) to create

CLAIM sentence:  The first part contained a list of those potentially compromised and the second summarised the content of the audio and video exhibits

CLAIM sentence:  On  August  Burton Copeland wrote to Louis Mably (junior counsel for the prosecution)

CLAIM sentence:  Conference with counsel on  August  On  August  a case conference took place at Counsels Chambers involving leading and junior counsel, Ms Carmen Dowd on behalf of the CPS, and various police officers, including DCS Williams

CLAIM sentence:  In order to ensure that the case remained manageable but also reflected the broad totality of the criminality, counsel advised that the matter should proceed to trial on the basis of four to six victims (in addition to those from the Royal Household) who should be selected as being representative of the group as a whole

CLAIM sentence:  The advice given by counsel was that this number of victims would afford the court adequate sentencing powers; it was important to provide a picture of the criminality so that its scope could be reflected

CLAIM sentence:  The inclusion of any more victims would not increase the sentencing powers of the court

CLAIM sentence:  We also enquired whether there was any evidence connecting Mulcaire to other News of the World journalists

CLAIM sentence:  I think, in fairness to everyone involved in the case, I think its right to say that this was still at a time when the information that we were obtaining was continuing to develop

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams does not dispute that counsel would have been told at the conference that there was no evidence that others at NoTW were involved in the conspiracy

CLAIM sentence:  In terms of there actually being evidence, and they had access to all the material, then I would agree: at that time, we didnt have evidence

CLAIM sentence:  When DCS Williams was asked about the reference to a production order and his note: if identifies other defendant consider, he said that the intention was that if the fruits of a production order revealed further suspects, they would consider the position at that time

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams described his thinking as follows: [Mr Mulcaire] has a contract for something like , a year

CLAIM sentence:  Whats he getting whys he got that? Whos tasking him? What are they tasking him with? And equally, whats he giving back? Dependent on the outcome of that, we would be able to do analysis in terms of, well, assessing, then, consider, actually, what is it that we might be able to do in terms of building a further case? 

CLAIM sentence:  Also after three years, on  July , DCS Williams provided a note to the CPS which contained his recollection of the conference

CLAIM sentence:  In it, he set out his belief that everyone recognised that proving that someone was the victim of interception was extremely challenging (a statement which, as Keir Starmer QC himself recognised, was consistent with the narrow view of the law)

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams further explained: In relation to whether or not anyone else was involved

CLAIM sentence:  At the very least, counsel and the CPS knew of the evidence supporting the charges that became counts - and were aware of the corner names which could implicate other journalists (because of counts  to )

CLAIM sentence:  It is also clear from the notes of the conference that counsel gave some consideration to the technical legal question which arose under RIPA namely whether it was necessary to prove that the unlawful interceptions had taken place before the voicemail messages had been listened to by their intended recipients

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Draft application not published  This is addressed below  This issue of the review of unused material is raised at different times and it is important to understand precisely what is involved in the exercise and what can be derived from it

CLAIM sentence:  Whether DCS Williams took away this message from this conference is less clear

CLAIM sentence:  In his witness statement for the purposes of the judicial review, DCS Williams said that counsel advised that counts  to  should be included in order to test the law

CLAIM sentence:  It is also worth adding that, at the same conference, counsel advised that the appropriate charges should be under RIPA; offences under the CMA (which had no technical problems) were not pursued so as to ensure a simpler presentation to a jury

CLAIM sentence:  The last topic discussed was the question of confiscation pursuant to s of the Proceeds of Crime Act 

CLAIM sentence:  Without setting out the detail of the relevant statutory provisions, a confiscation order, in essence, requires a convicted defendant to pay a sum of money representing the level of his or her financial benefit from his or her criminal conduct

CLAIM sentence:  Victims not associated with the Royal Household 

CLAIM sentence:  Following the conference, the investigating officers set about contacting victims to ascertain whether they would be willing to provide evidence in support of the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees gave evidence that one of these victims was Tessa Jowell and, furthermore, that she  It equally had no bearing on the later decision not to broaden the investigation, which was taken for other reasons

CLAIM sentence:  See paras 

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript- of-Morning-Hearing--April-

CLAIM sentence:  She provided her account in these terms: I remember very clearly the conversation, which, as I say, took place on holiday

CLAIM sentence:  I happened to be by the swimming pool with very close friends that I was on holiday with

CLAIM sentence:  I would also say that I was a secretary of state and a privy councillor

CLAIM sentence:  It would have been absolutely incumbent on me, were I asked to co-operate with an inquiry, to agree to

CLAIM sentence:  My principal private secretary, who is a civil servant, confirmed my willingness to help, as too the two friends that I was on who I recounted this too, are also abundantly clear about the account of the conversation that I gave them

CLAIM sentence:  I asked if I needed to provide a statement or further assistance

CLAIM sentence:  It is not necessary to decide how DCS Surtees came to recall otherwise save that I do not conclude that he was deliberately seeking to minimise the impact on NI: had he wished to do that, he would not have spoken to her in the first place

CLAIM sentence:  A large number of those on the list were celebrities and well-known public figures, whilst others appeared to be company names

CLAIM sentence:  On  August  DI Maberly emailed Orange to ask if there was an indication of interception of the voicemail messages of six named individuals, including Simon Hughes

CLAIM sentence:  He also sent an email to Vodafone asking if anyone had listened to the voicemail of nine named people

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of the information that became available, an appropriate number of victims (additional to those emanating from the Royal Household) were identified as the named victims for the charges that were represented by counts  to  of the indictment directed at Glenn Mulcaire (and not part of the conspiracy count which involved Clive Goodman)

CLAIM sentence:  They were chosen, essentially, because of the high volume of frequency of calls (along with  Loc

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams gave evidence that, in early September , the police contacted Rebekah Brooks (then editor of The Sun) to notify her that she was a potential victim of voicemail interception and to ascertain whether she wanted to make a formal complaint in that capacity

CLAIM sentence:  Since the  million figure is not supported by evidence available contemporaneously or subsequently it is simply not clear where this figure came from

CLAIM sentence:  Again, the present investigation and prosecution precludes any further investigation of this issue

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst there could well be a concern that this meeting provided the opportunity for the exercise of inappropriate influence over the police investigation (and perhaps rather more thought should have been given to the perception that could result from the meeting), there is not the slightest evidence that this was a reality

CLAIM sentence:  Again, there is no evidential basis for concluding that this meeting impacted in any way on the police investigation

CLAIM sentence:  The approach of Burton Copeland In order to obtain relevant evidence from NI, the CPS advised the police to enter into correspondence with them (though Burton Copeland)

CLAIM sentence:  This was because the legislative provisions for obtaining a production order, which would require NI to produce journalistic material to the police or provide the police with access to it required other methods to have been tried without success or that it be established that such methods were bound to fail

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, a court would be unlikely to make a production order, requiring a person or organisation to hand over such journalistic material, if it were satisfied that the person or organisation in possession of the material appeared to be cooperating with the police

CLAIM sentence:  On  August  DI Maberly attended Burton Copelands offices and made a number of requests for information

CLAIM sentence:  That same day Burton Copeland wrote a letter to the police, apparently stating an intention to cooperate fully with all their reasonable requests for information: On behalf of my clients, Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd, I would wish to make it plain that in connection with the enquiries that you are presently conducting and which are referred to in the Application under the Schedule  of the Police and Criminal  See s

CLAIM sentence:  () and Schedule  to PACE and, in particular, para (b); para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Burton Copeland enclosed a file labelled Newsgroup International Payments to Nine Consultancy Ltd which they asserted contained the requested information and included in particular: 

CLAIM sentence:  A schedule that has been created from the records maintained of all payments to the accounts referred to in the PACE Application; 

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly also followed up the meeting with a letter, which he delivered to Burton Copelands offices on  September 

CLAIM sentence:  (e) Records of any work completed 

CLAIM sentence:  These items were not seized or searched but were subject to a retention request

CLAIM sentence:  written notes, data files, cassette/ digital recordings etc) Material relating to any voicemail(s) that may have been listened to (e

CLAIM sentence:  Burton Copeland had drafted a letter dated  September , which they gave to DI Maberly when he visited their premises on  September 

CLAIM sentence:  We stress, however, that the procedure under Part  of the  Act is a procedure designed to produce documentation or other material in the possession of an individual

CLAIM sentence:  It is not a procedure designed to elicit answers other than those contained within such material

CLAIM sentence:  They are, however, entirely satisfied that the material to which you are entitled is limited and that you  p, ibid  pp-, ibid  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xc

CLAIM sentence:  are now, along with material previously submitted, in possession of all relevant documentation It is interesting to note that Burton Copeland were precise in seeking to confine the entitlement of the police to documents in the possession of an individual as opposed to documents held by NI generally

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and DI Maberly all formed the impression that whilst Burton Copeland were protesting that they were cooperating, the reality was the opposite

CLAIM sentence:  In evidence DI Maberly agreed that he was very suspicious that he was being fobbed off

CLAIM sentence:  After  September , no further documents were produced by Burton Copeland

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately therefore, NI provided the MPS with extremely scant information

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS describes this, correctly in my judgment, as a veneer of cooperation

CLAIM sentence:  Despite their protestations to the contrary, NI were not helping the police with their enquiries

CLAIM sentence:  It is relevant that once NI decided, in January , fully to co-operate with the MPS, that is exactly what happened and the investigations that have become Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta (with subsidiary operations associated with them) has been the result

CLAIM sentence:  While signalling the intention of NI now to place itself in the position of demonstrating that it takes compliance with the criminal law extremely seriously, it undeniably casts light on what had happened previously

CLAIM sentence:  I am not in a position to judge what part, if any, Burton Copeland played in the approach to the police investigation in , what their instructions were or the advice they gave because NI has not waived the legal professional privilege which attaches to this material

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, the public can only know what Burton Copeland did and not why they did it

CLAIM sentence:  In support of the contention that NI was cooperating, Rupert Murdoch referred to appointing a special law firm to look into this and to aid our co-operation with the police When he was told, during his evidence, that the Inquiry had heard evidence that the solicitors firm concerned provided limited documentation that did not represent the position at all and that, one way or another, NI was being obstructive Rupert Murdoch said: That shocks me deeply, and I was unaware of it and Ive not heard of it until youve just said that

CLAIM sentence: uk/ wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing--February-

CLAIM sentence:  The documentation provided was nonetheless extremely limited and unrepresentative of the true position  p, lines -, Rupert Murdoch, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  An organisational culture that is founded on integrity and honesty would require not only full co-operation with law enforcement, but also a determination to expose behaviour that failed to comply with the law

CLAIM sentence:  That would normally be achieved through a thorough internal investigation of any allegation, unaffected by the legal constraints that the police might face, in order to ensure that any wrongdoing in the company was uncovered, stopped and dealt with appropriately

CLAIM sentence:  The report of the High Tech Crime Unit 

CLAIM sentence:  The investigating officers were concerned to discover that within the report were the details of people who had been given new identities as part of the witness protection programme

CLAIM sentence:  The extreme sensitivity of this information does not require elaboration

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees instructed DI Maberly to contact the witness protection unit, provide them with the list of names and ask them to take whatever action they considered necessary

CLAIM sentence:  When DI Maberly did so: it quickly became apparent that contained within were names of interest to [the unit]

CLAIM sentence:  The report of the High Tech Crime Unit included the following statement: It is also believed attempts may have been made to corrupt serving police officers and misuse the Police National Computer

CLAIM sentence:  It is argued by the Core Participant Victims that the apparent failure to act on this adds to the impression that there were areas of investigation which were highly sensitive and which made the MPS unwilling to probe further

CLAIM sentence:  Although I understand the concern, it would not be appropriate for me to go further

CLAIM sentence:  Suffice to say, the current criminal investigation continues and my determination not to prejudice that investigation has meant that further detail has not been explored in the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The points that I have made about the individual officers responsible for the conduct of Operation Caryatid are not affected and remain, even if there was some additional thread which could have been followed

CLAIM sentence:  From the perspective of the management at NI, the sentencing remarks ought to have raised serious alarm bells that there may have been other journalists in the newsroom engaging in illegal or unethical activity; what otherwise should have been needed to launch a full scale review into every aspect of the work that Glenn Mulcaire had done for the NoTW? 

CLAIM sentence:  One of the most serious allegations against the police relates to the deliberate decision effectively to shut down Operation Caryatid when it is argued that there was clearly much more that could have been uncovered

CLAIM sentence:  It is suggested that the decision not to pursue further investigations could have been affected by the relationship between the officers of the MPS and NI or, in other words, had not been taken in good faith or for good operational reasons

CLAIM sentence:  The background Police resources are finite and the decision not to widen the Operation Caryatid investigation cannot properly be understood without a full understanding of the operational context at the time

CLAIM sentence:  More specifically, for what had been SO, whose primary commitment was to counter terrorism, the issue was the scale and immediacy of the threat from terrorism at the time and the massive pressure on resources that it entailed

CLAIM sentence:  During - there was an accelerating tempo of terrorist investigations There were many other strands of intelligence that showed the threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism was not only a reality, but growing in intensity

CLAIM sentence:  In , there was a major escalation in our understanding of the scale and nature of terrorist plotting in the UK with the discovery, early in the year that a group of British citizens were planning to make and detonate a large bomb

CLAIM sentence:  This required what was then the largest ever UK surveillance operation to control the threat posed by the plotters and to gather evidence to convict them

CLAIM sentence:  This operation was called Operation Crevice 

CLAIM sentence:  Later in , there was another major investigation called Operation Rhyme which dismantled a terrorist network led by a veteran jihadist called Dhiren Barot, whose ambition was to mount attacks, including the use of radiological devices, both in the US and the UK

CLAIM sentence:  These cases and others showed a clear intention on the part of terrorists to attack the UK mainland to try to kill as many people as possible whenever possible 

CLAIM sentence:  In July , despite the best efforts of the UK counter terrorist community, London was twice attacked to devastating effect

CLAIM sentence:  This one turned out to be a plan to blow up, simultaneously, a number of transatlantic airliners en route from the UK to the USA As with other major terrorist cases, the prosecutions in Operation Overt took a long time to come to fruition

CLAIM sentence:  In fact they took some  years and were spread over   http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This all needed a massive commitment of officers from the Counter Terrorism Command (SO)

CLAIM sentence:  The impact of this was that those of us who were charged with protecting the public from the effects of terrorism were more than fully committed on matters that directly affected the safety of the British public

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, during the surveillance operation in support of Operation Crevice in early , every available surveillance team from within the MPS and indeed beyond was used on the enquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Investigations into drug trafficking, murder and other serious crime, including internal corruption enquiries, came second to the need to protect the public from terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  Despite all the support that was received throughout these years, and particularly after the attacks on London in , by the time Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested in August  the Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO) had some  live terrorist cases on its books, but insufficient resources to investigate them all

CLAIM sentence:  There was prioritisation even with life threatening terrorist cases, and that is the context within which the decisions that were taken to investigate possible invasions of privacy under Operation Caryatid must be considered

CLAIM sentence:  Elaborating on this statement, it is clear that, since , there had been repeated attempts by Al-Qaeda networks to commit mass casualty suicide attacks

CLAIM sentence:  On  July and  July , there was a series of coordinated suicide terrorist attacks and follow up attacks

CLAIM sentence:  The investigators, including DCS Williams, did not dispute, however, that they had material that implicated other journalists and investigative leads that could have been followed

CLAIM sentence:  The following is a stock-take of the matters the investigators had specifically identified by that time

CLAIM sentence:  Not only did Clive appear as a corner name in relation to the Royal Household voicemail message interceptions but there were corner names associated with counts  to  on the indictment

CLAIM sentence:  There were financial and editorial evidential leads available to the police relating to published articles and payments for them

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly believed that three of the corner names in particular were the names of journalists at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  When pressed, he agreed that there was circumstantial evidence, but went on to say (as is undoubtedly the case) that he would have needed something more substantial in order to obtain a conviction

CLAIM sentence:  During his evidence, however, DCS Williams appeared to assert, that there was no evidence that other journalists were involved

CLAIM sentence:  This has caused concern that DCS Williams failed to recognise the evidential value of the matters the police had established

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams is emphatic that his use of the expression no evidence has been taken out of context and that he did not mean that there was no evidence whatsoever, but rather that such material as had been collected, was insufficient to prosecute

CLAIM sentence:  Given that DCS Williams was plainly aware of the material that pointed towards other journalists and was correct in his assessment that a considerable amount of further work would have had to be done before a further prosecution could have been contemplated; I am prepared to accept his submissions on this issue

CLAIM sentence:  It is obviously important not to prejudice or appear to pre-judge the criminal process by expressing too robust a view of the material then (or now) available

CLAIM sentence:  This analysis of the material seized would have to have preceded an application for a production order because the court would expect the police to have a clear idea of what they already had in their possession before seeking to compel the production of journalistic material

CLAIM sentence:  The law requires the police to make proportionate applications, which focus on what is strictly required

CLAIM sentence:  The law does not permit wide-ranging, speculative fishing expeditions

CLAIM sentence:  The Operation Caryatid investigators would not have been in a position to identify what was strictly required until they had ascertained what evidence they already had

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees said that during the briefing: it was made very clear that, given the unprecedented amount of operations currently live within SO and the huge demand this was having on the CT command, this matter was not to be investigated beyond the original parameters

CLAIM sentence:  Moreover, all efforts were put into preparing the prosecution case to ensure the conviction of Mulcaire and Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  Secondly, the original objectives of the investigation could be achieved through the following measures: The very public prosecution and imprisonment of a senior journalist from a national newspaper for these offences; Collaboration with the mobile phone industry to prevent such invasions of privacy in the future; and Briefings to Government, including the Home Office and Cabinet Office designed to alert them to this activity and to ensure that national security concerns could be addressed

CLAIM sentence:  He added in evidence that the investigation was, to be honest, not anywhere near the top of our level our concerns because, remember, we are dealing with the airline plot and a whole range of other terrorist operations at that time

CLAIM sentence:  His reaction to questions on this issue was that he had enough information to make a properly informed decision: Even though I didnt know some of the intimate details of the case, and indeed details which, with hindsight, you could say were very important, I still think I had enough information available to me to make the overall decision about the future direction of the inquiry, because I still cant see any way in which we could have done that without exhaustive analysis of all of that material

CLAIM sentence:  He was asked whether from reviewing the decision logs in preparation for the Select Committee hearing and having heard some of the evidence from the investigating officers during the Inquiry, he had a different impression or understanding of the quality of the evidence insofar as other journalists were concerned

CLAIM sentence:  I am merely saying another course of action could have been taken, and perhaps at that stage the information would have come out about there being lots more names and indications of a lot more people involved and then things would have been very different

CLAIM sentence:  It was also important for another reason: it deprived the police of an important protection from allegations of impropriety, which, in this case, have caused serious damage to the reputation of the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul Stephenson made similar comments with which I also completely agree

CLAIM sentence:  Secondly you have to try and ensure, I think, in the future that we make those decisions transparent so they can withstand this level of scrutiny

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, the officers were asked about the feasibility of investigative steps short of such an analysis

CLAIM sentence:  They were also asked whether they could have arrested the three journalists from the NoTW identified by DI Maberly

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees said: Whilst the most probable explanation for the corner names was that journalists at NOTW were in receipt of this information and that they could be aware of the illegal practises [sic], the difficulty was proving this

CLAIM sentence:  As a further possibility, it was put to DCS Williams that he could have asked the NoTW to provide him with a list of journalists, perhaps limited to particular desks

CLAIM sentence:  There would be a whole range of questions and things that I would want to get put together to have a cogent case as to now why am I speaking to this individual

CLAIM sentence:  Not simply the fact that their name is Im making this up Bill, because thats on a corner name, and they happen to be Bill someone employed in this papers

CLAIM sentence:  I would need more than that

CLAIM sentence:  He repeated that he would have wanted to go through all the material because: That is a proper and professional way of carrying out a criminal investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Its not done piecemeal or bit by bit

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst I do not accept that, of necessity, furthering the investigation was all or nothing, and that certain preliminary steps could not have been taken to see what they yielded, I have no doubt that DCS Williams honestly held the view that the only satisfactory approach was to examine the Mulcaire archive both systematically and comprehensively

CLAIM sentence:  The next possibility, suggested to DCS Surtees was that he could have obtained the call data in relation to a limited number of victims listed in the blue book and see who else might have been calling into their voicemail boxes

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees agreed that the potential victim concerned could be asked to exclude the numbers they recognised

CLAIM sentence:  A RIPA application would then have had to be made on a speculative basis, which may well have been insufficient to satisfy the officer charged with deciding whether to grant a RIPA authorisation, because the number could quite easily belong to an entirely innocent party

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees was also asked whether he considered and discussed with his senior officers a more limited investigation in the first instance, for example by targeting the most senior journalists, because he would be able to find out their relevant phone numbers

CLAIM sentence:  Again, taking account of the response of DCS Surtees to the questions on this topic, that to the extent that he, and indeed DCS Williams, did not consider whether steps short of a major investigation might be feasible, the absence of such consideration was based on a judgment made in good faith and was not influenced by any desire to protect or propitiate NI

CLAIM sentence:  His response was: Well, potentially, but I dont see how you could take part of that material and subject it to analysis with all the cross-referencing and so on that would have to happen, and so inevitably I think it would lead to an analysis of all the material

CLAIM sentence:  He said: I see what youre saying and with hindsight there are probably all sorts of approaches that could have been taken, but in the light of what I was aware of at the time, what I knew and the competing demands, I made the decision that we would not do so

CLAIM sentence:  However, he subsequently re-stated his initial position, namely that the investigation could not have moved forwards without an exhaustive analysis of the material

CLAIM sentence:  I am not in a position to judge whether further tentative enquiries would have borne sufficient fruit to prosecute other journalists without there being a disproportionate drain on resources

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence I heard from each of them, and how they have justified their decisions, gives me no cause to doubt that their decisions were unaffected by the fact that the target of the further investigation would have been NI journalists or editors

CLAIM sentence:  It is fair to add that DCS Williams also had concerns about whether the huge resource injection that he believed would be required to take the investigation further would be justified by what such an investigation might realistically yield (which itself might have added to his cautious approach)

CLAIM sentence:  He said: All along, I we had some grounds to suspect that this could be wider and that indeed if we undertook further research we may find something

CLAIM sentence:  What I didnt know and what I was clear about is what we would find, and actually what it would amount to

CLAIM sentence:  What I was very cognisant of, as indeed we all were, was the amount of work it had taken to get us to where we were, particularly in terms of the technical difficulties

CLAIM sentence:  The other dimension that we were very conscious of is we had achieved that in a covert operation, where nobody knew what we were doing, nobody understood what we were looking for, and they couldnt hide evidence

CLAIM sentence:  At the moment this was now very clear about what we were doing and what evidence we were looking for, and it is not unreasonable to think that it would be a far more challenging operation in terms of the implication of the resources that you would need

CLAIM sentence:  It is likely that this mind set also contributed to the cautious approach that DCS Williams took to the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, it has been argued that all that would have been needed to include additional journalists on the indictment would have been to ask NI for a list of journalists and cross- refer the list with the corner names

CLAIM sentence:  Neither do I doubt their enthusiasm or their desire to investigate the criminality before them to the fullest extent possible within the limits of the resources available to them

CLAIM sentence:  Also, when asked whether he would have liked there to have been a full scale criminal investigation into other journalists, his answer was: absolutely

CLAIM sentence:  He explained, however, that he understood the priorities: So in terms of what I would have liked to have done coupled with my obligations and the seriousness of the investigations I was involved in, I knew where my priorities lay, and those were with the issues of serious threat to life investigations

CLAIM sentence:  Thats where I needed to be and thats where my staff needed to be

CLAIM sentence:  And if I personalise that, if there was an agenda from me or any other person, Assistant Commissioner, who wanted to dilute or disproportionately ramp up that operation, it would be impossible for that to happen without the SIO calling foul or asking for that individual to record why they want something done in that decision log

CLAIM sentence:  Because of the serious concern expressed, this aspect of the police operation has been examined in detail

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, I ought finally to record the views of the independent Queens Counsel instructed to advise and conduct the prosecution, who dealt with the officers on a regular basis

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams said that he wrote the outcome of the discussion in a document entitled Informing Potential Victims

CLAIM sentence:  The list of victims will then represent the most definitive list of people who have had their voicemails intercepted

CLAIM sentence:  There is arguably a duty to inform people when they have been a victim of crime and in this case I believe that duty should be undertaken for those people who we know are victims by virtue of the fact that our suspects called their voicemails (UVNs)

CLAIM sentence:  That list will be identified as above and the next step is to decide when and how they should be informed

CLAIM sentence:  Issues to bear in mind if informing victims Informing all of the victims could be resource intensive which SO can ill afford at this juncture given the current terrorist threat

CLAIM sentence:  Although the techniques for voicemail interception may not be limited to these suspects it is unlikely these two will have shared them with a wider audience given the potential earning value of the technique

CLAIM sentence:  Equally our investigation to date has not identified any other suspects calling the UVNs of our main victims

CLAIM sentence:  There is a rationale for saying that the risk to victims has been significantly reduced due to police action and therefore a more measured and proportionate approach can be taken in terms of who and when the victims are informed

CLAIM sentence:  Options In terms of the, who and when, the following are options: 

CLAIM sentence:  irrespective of whether there was a new or old message in the voicemail box

CLAIM sentence:  It was not sufficient that they merely appeared in the Mulcaire papers or were listed in the blue book

CLAIM sentence:  A considerable amount of work had been invested in the blue book, which provided a list of potential victims (as DCS Surtees intended)

CLAIM sentence:  Plainly, the police should have ensured that all those named in the blue book were notified and the plan should have been devised on that basis

CLAIM sentence:  I see no reason for believing that this would have been a disproportionate drain on resources

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, the detail of the strategy was such that it excluded people listed in the blue book but in respect of whom there was no evidence that their voicemails had been called by the suspect numbers

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams was asked why everyone named in the blue book was not notified

CLAIM sentence:  By implication, this was irrespective of whether there was a voicemail message at all

CLAIM sentence:  This was plainly the correct approach given that regardless of the applicability of s of RIPA, the accessing of any voicemail message amounts to a criminal offence under s of the CMA

CLAIM sentence:  So thats where its actually in the when and the how that Im seeking or I was hoping through this strategy to address that much wider pool of people, which would have included everybody on that list

CLAIM sentence:  This answer suggests that DCS Williams failed to recognise that the ambit of the strategy simply did not encompass, even theoretically, everyone identified in the blue book

CLAIM sentence:  I believed the strategy was being carried out as an ongoing process and I had merely formalised the process at a moment in time with the official endorsement of my senior management

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams: Albeit all of the companies and police were pragmatic in sharing data in what potentially would bring us to an administrative halt if we went down the full process, neither party was willing to share long lists of names for obvious privacy/data protection reasons

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore the informing potential victim strategy embraced these issues by providing the optimum, discrete [sic] means of informing anyone who was identified as a potential victim supported by a single, well worn route for those who may wish to report the matter to police

CLAIM sentence:  At no time did I or indeed anybody else from the police team ask for this to stop, even post arrest and charge

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst I was not explicit as to what these companies should do around informing and keeping their customers up to date, I held the belief that this was, in fact, being done

CLAIM sentence:  At no time were they ever restricted from informing those customers, although the extent of the information passed would be limited

CLAIM sentence:  Further, it was not for the police to dictate to private companies how to execute their internal procedures and how to deal with their own customers

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that O did notify a number of their customers, but it appears that they did so of their own initiative and not because they were asked to by the police as part of the victim notification strategy

CLAIM sentence:  When making its opening statement to the Inquiry, the MPS fully accepted that the victim notification strategy was not properly executed

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS states that it accepts that it should have done more to ensure the strategy was fully implemented, but argues that this needs to be seen in the context of the huge demand on what became SO resources in -, as a result of several major counter terrorism operations

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment, these resource considerations simply do not explain why the basic steps required were not taken to ensure that the phone companies were aware of what the police expected them to do and agreed both to do it and to the terms of a joint letter

CLAIM sentence:  It is also of course utterly regrettable that as a result of the decision  See paras 

CLAIM sentence:  Vodafone and Orange expressly denied having been asked to do so  p, para , John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  It acknowledged that it failed to take prompt, reasonable and proportionate steps to ensure that those identified as victims were made aware  Second witness statement of Keith Surtees, to be published after this Report  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The failure of the victim notification strategy reduced the opportunity for other victims to make themselves known and created a perception that has caused significant damage to the reputation of the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Once again, the important question is whether there is an evidential basis for finding that the police deliberately failed to notify people because they did not want the scale of the interceptions to be known publicly, which might itself have called into question both their strategy and their relationship with NI

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS contends forcefully that the failure of the strategy had nothing to do with inappropriately close relationships with (or fear of) members of the press, or any of the risks arising from such relationships as there were

CLAIM sentence:  Far from it, the whole aim was to secure maximum public awareness of the vulnerability through an effective and decisive criminal prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams was asked whether it was a fair observation that part of the reason for the failure of the strategy was the fear that notifying all potential victims would mean the matter would enter the public domain more explosively and force the police to carry out an investigation which they did not really want

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams said: Its not

CLAIM sentence:  I understand thats whats being said now, but I can assure you that was absolutely not the intention

CLAIM sentence:  I wanted to make this as public as possible, and the most obvious way of doing that is through a prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  If I hadnt have wanted to have done it, I could have stopped this investigation much earlier, but that was absolutely not my intention

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to note that, on  August  DI Maberly emailed Vodafone asking if they could tell him whether anyone has listened to the voicemail of a number of people, which included Tracey Temple (Prescott)

CLAIM sentence:  Further, on  October , DI Maberly emailed O identifying two persons of concern and asking O if they featured in the analysis O was preparing: the first name was Joan Hammell (linked to prezza)

CLAIM sentence:  What I was briefed about was, yes, there are now from the material a number of other people in all walks of life, that include politicians, where it may be that they are potentially people who Mulcaire or others might want to target in terms of their voicemail

CLAIM sentence:  The police had devised a strategy for bringing the matter to public attention, which included notification of specifically identified victims

CLAIM sentence:  It was not their overall intention that was at fault but, rather, the detail of the strategy and its implementation

CLAIM sentence:  It would be remarkable to embark on the exercise if their intention was to keep hidden what they had found

CLAIM sentence:  It dealt with the information that was put out for offer

CLAIM sentence:  This was in the margins of a meeting about broader counter terrorism issues in the immediate aftermath of the Operation Overt arrests, and was of little significance other than to demonstrate that the Home Office had been informed of the arrests and the broad nature of the case that was alleged against Goodman and Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  I think it was my final meeting

CLAIM sentence:  I cant be sure of that, but I think the final meeting was around May with Ian

CLAIM sentence:  Not only do I conclude that a deliberate failure to inform victims was inconsistent with the evident desire of the police to bring the matter to public attention generally, but neither do I find it plausible that the officers concerned would devise a victim notification strategy which they never intended to execute

CLAIM sentence:  By far the more plausible explanation for the failure of the notification strategy is that SO, having been successful in its primary objective, simply took its eye off the ball in circumstances where it was extremely keen to return to what might be described as its core business, namely counter-terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  It has also been argued that when the police did notify victims, they favoured media contacts

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, the High Tech Crime Unit had specifically highlighted his name in the introduction to the document as someone about whom attempts had been made to obtain information

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, I consider that the undoubted failures of notification are not the result of cover-up or preferential treatment and favouritism towards the press but rather of poor strategy, and poor implementation of such strategy as existed with insufficient consideration to the importance that many if not most of the victims would attach to learning what had or might have happened to them

CLAIM sentence:  However justifiable their decision not to follow the evidential leads implicating other journalists might have been, that approach, brought with it an expectation that the police would take all other steps reasonably available to them to prevent the recurrence of the crime

CLAIM sentence:  I am not suggesting that they could make allegations about those whom they had not investigated; distancing the police from these conclusions, however, would, at least, have provided some context

CLAIM sentence:  He agreed that if the police had done so, then they could have pointed out, when reference was made to a single rogue reporter, that the police put them right because this did not do justice to the extent of the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  This would not have taken a great deal of police resource

CLAIM sentence:  This step did not, however, cross the mind of DCS Williams

CLAIM sentence:  He said: I didnt think to specifically do that

CLAIM sentence:  I if I think of your question and look back, I feel we made it abundantly clear what our understanding was and what our suspicions were in terms of the requests that we made to them

CLAIM sentence:  He went on to say that: Actually, I thought Id already done that, had made it very clear, not just to them, but to any organisation that might be engaged in this, that might want to consider are we also doing this

CLAIM sentence:  That was the whole purpose

CLAIM sentence:  On any showing, by strongly advising that course of action, it was open to the police to maximise the chances that the issues would be addressed

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS argues that the omission to warn NI as to its future conduct was not a failing and that it did all that was reasonable (given the relevant context and state of knowledge at the time) to raise concerns with NI

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS submits that the attempted search of NI would have sent a very clear message to NI that the MPS was seeking any evidence of criminality and by implication a halt to any further criminal practice

CLAIM sentence:  Also, that the correspondence sent to Burton Copeland demonstrated the attempts made by the MPS to bring to the attention of NI both the nature and extent of the documentation required and by implication the practice of voicemail interception within NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS also relies on the prosecution itself, stating that this alone should have sent a very clear message to all media organisations, not just NI, that voicemail interception was illegal and would not be tolerated

CLAIM sentence:  I have no doubt that everyone understood the gravity of the position if it was detected

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, the deterrent effect of the prosecution would have been substantially reduced by the fact that NI had arguably thwarted a wider investigation by interfering with the searches in Wapping and by adopting the attitude reflected in the approach of Burton Copeland to requests for information and documents

CLAIM sentence:  The deterrent effect would also be reduced by the fact that, despite the indications of wider criminality at NI, the investigation had been closed

CLAIM sentence:  The matters relied upon by the MPS are simply not in the order of what, in my judgment, was required of them before they put Operation Caryatid behind them

CLAIM sentence:  Those changes were: ensuring that contributors to the newspaper clearly understood their responsibility to comply with the Code and NI policies and procedures; ensuring that all journalists focussed on the importance of the Code and legal compliance and the risk of dismissal for failure to comply; and instituting processes to ensure that large cash sums could not be paid without appropriate authority

CLAIM sentence: htm See also Q, Damian Collins, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Not a reporting role that involved interaction with the public in any other way, but perhaps book filleting or book serialisation, possibly

CLAIM sentence:  In all the circumstances, we would of course be entitled to make no payment whateverYou will be paid, through payroll, on  February ,  months base salary, subject to normal deductions of tax and nation insurance

CLAIM sentence:  His first two grounds of appeal were first, that the decision was perverse because his actions were carried out with the full knowledge and support of executives at the NoTW and second, that the decision was inconsistent because others, who were still working for the NoTW, were engaged in the same illegal procedures

CLAIM sentence:  The list included emails passing between him and various named members of staff

CLAIM sentence:  Wed been asked to look for whether there was evidence in emails that supported specific allegations, and to have then signed off on an opinion that was much wider than the exercise wed been conducting would have been wholly wrong and I couldnt have done that

CLAIM sentence:  The final wording was the following: I can confirm that we did not find anything in those emails which appear to us to be reasonable evidence that Clive Goodmans illegal activities were known about and supported 

CLAIM sentence:  When asked whether he had shared his view with others at NI that the one rogue reporter claim was wrong he replied:  I had discussions which were privileged, yes

CLAIM sentence:  The speed and content of his reply appear to support his claim not to have focused on the key allegation

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch said that it was established at the meeting that it was better to settle at an amount that would avoid litigating a case that would be lost than drag up all these things, a painful episode in the past and what not

CLAIM sentence:  Given the significance of the issue, it is necessary also to deal with the extent to which Rupert Murdoch had knowledge of the relevant facts

CLAIM sentence:  He said that he first learned of it in  and was very surprised by the size of the settlement

CLAIM sentence:  It also depends on precisely what he was told on  June 

CLAIM sentence:  likely to get worse as the other known victims (as represented by the criminal investigation if none other) could and doubtless would also pursue claims

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, the nature of the process of this part of the Inquiry has meant that, in relation to these extremely fact sensitive meetings, there has been insufficient opportunity for detailed cross examination of precisely what was said by whom to whom

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, I do not seek to reach any conclusion about precisely what transpired at this meeting

CLAIM sentence:  For present purposes, it is sufficient to repeat that whoevers account is correct as to what happened on  June , there was no subsequent analysis of the consequences in relation to oversight and internal governance

CLAIM sentence:  On any showing, these questions were there to be asked and simple denials should not have been considered sufficient

CLAIM sentence:  This suggests a cover up by somebody and at more than one level

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction Although the NoTW was having to cope with the consequences of Operation Caryatid both in relation to Clive Goodman, Glenn Mulcaire, Andy Coulson and all those who then wished to pursue claims for damages, in the immediate aftermath of the prosecution and notwithstanding what journalists knew, believed or had gossiped about in relation to voicemail interception, until the Guardian article, there is no evidence that the wider issue (or the police investigation) was considered in any detail by the press

CLAIM sentence:  When the Guardian (and, subsequently, the New York Times) did publish articles, both the Police and the PCC reacted

CLAIM sentence:  They did so, however, in ways that have raised more questions than they answered and, in the context of this Part of the Inquiry, require detailed consideration

CLAIM sentence:  More specifically, this Inquiry must address the public concern about the decisions taken by the MPS in  and  to the effect that there was nothing in what was reported in the press to justify further examination despite the claim that the MPS itself held evidence that implicated other journalists and which would merit further investigation

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, it boils down to the question whether any relationship between the MPS and NI, or between officers within the MPS and senior management in NI influenced the decisions which were then made

CLAIM sentence:  To address that issue, the focus of this section is upon the reasons why, until January , the MPS, and the then Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, in particular, asserted and maintained the position that there was no evidence of further criminality and that absent new evidence, there was no reason to re-open the  investigation, despite the facts, first, that the detectives involved in Operation Caryatid knew that there was evidence implicating other journalists, but which had not been taken further in  because of resource constraints and, second, that the police held vast quantities of material that had not been fully analysed in 

CLAIM sentence:  The allegations made by the Guardian On  and  July  the Guardian published an article which exposed that NGN had paid out more than  million to settle claims for the reason that the claims threatened to reveal evidence of its journalists repeated involvement in the use of criminal methods to obtain stories

CLAIM sentence:  The article claimed that the evidence posed difficult questions for Andy Coulson, Rupert Murdoch executives and, in addition: (a) (b) (c) the MPS who did not alert all those whose phones were targeted; the CPS, which did not pursue all possible charges against News Group personnel; and the PCC, which claimed to have conducted an investigation but failed to uncover any evidence of illegal activity

CLAIM sentence:  The article then went on: However, one senior source at the Met

CLAIM sentence:  It continued: The Scotland Yard paperwork also provided evidence that the News of the World had been involved with Glenn Mulcaire in his hacking the mobile phones of at least two other figures from the world of football

CLAIM sentence:  It was not the case that the Guardian was alleging that it had uncovered evidence that the police had not been able to obtain themselves

CLAIM sentence:  The article prompted a number of responses which bear detailed examination although the response from NI itself can be dealt with shortly

CLAIM sentence:  There has been some misunderstanding and debate about the term review a review in police terms is a comprehensive piece of work which involves a substantial number of people reviewing an entire investigation or particular aspects of one Reviews are resource intensive and there has to be a compelling reason for a decision to devote staff and officers to undertake one

CLAIM sentence:  New evidence or new information could obviously be a compelling reason, although it is likely that a scoping exercise would be carried out first to decide whether such a decision was merited

CLAIM sentence:  The article of  July  provided no such new evidence or new information that merited a full review

CLAIM sentence:  This was significant because, according to the Guardian, there appeared to be a conspiracy involving reporters at the NoTW which possibly encompassed senior executives responsible for reporters

CLAIM sentence:  I simply do not accept that argument: in my judgment, the facts that made it inappropriate for him to look into the allegations made by the Guardian were known at the time

CLAIM sentence:  On the one hand his thinking was to the effect that this is nothing, we do this all the time, it is no big deal; but on the other hand, he clearly thought it was sufficiently important that he should deal with it himself and that it was necessary for an Assistant Commissioner to front the consideration of the article and, very quickly, to speak to the press about it

CLAIM sentence:  There was no question of delegating the task

CLAIM sentence:  I didnt give it any particular thought

CLAIM sentence:  It is not as if, in our professional lives, that we dont actually, as chief constables and senior officers, investigate people who are known to us socially and who have been friends, and to actually say somebody else has to deal with it would almost be saying that I do not have sufficient integrity to deal with it

CLAIM sentence:  Whether, with hindsight, it might have been wise to do that, I think thats an entirely different question

CLAIM sentence:  I can understand why he didnt do it, but with hindsight it might have been wise

CLAIM sentence:  He clarified his evidence as follows: Well, as a police officer, when Ive been asked to do discipline and complaints in the past going back years, yes, Ive investigated people who have been known to me

CLAIM sentence:  This clarification, in fact, answers a different question to that being addressed

CLAIM sentence:  This briefing was about the material discovered, the actions taken and the decisions made just short of three years beforehand, when there can be no doubt that the officers had since been involved in extremely complex counter terrorism investigations

CLAIM sentence:  These included the question: Why was there not a more wide ranging investigation? According to the minutes, he was told that the reason was that: There was no evidence to expand the investigation wider, which, if it had done, then this would have been an ineffective use of public resources

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, it appears that in the mind of DCS Williams on  July , that understanding had become a belief that, although there had been plenty of speculation that other journalists had been involved, the sum total of the evidence uncovered by Operation Caryatid was not capable of being taken forward or developed as part of a wider investigation

CLAIM sentence:  I consider that the answers given by DCS Williams did not accurately reflect not only the value of the material that the police had seized but also the way in which the investigation had been brought to an end

CLAIM sentence:  Given the haste with which this fact-finding exercise was being undertaken, however, it is difficult to be over-critical of DCS Williams at this stage

CLAIM sentence:  When he came to make a statement in September , DCS Williams had obviously had the chance of reviewing the contemporaneous material in detail and so was able to deal with the matter rather more reflectively and in greater detail than would ever have been possible in July 

CLAIM sentence:  The contrast is obvious

CLAIM sentence:  On balance it was felt that the safety of the public was more important that protecting invasions of privacy; and that it was not the job of police to regulate the media, rather that it should regulate itself through the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The differences are important

CLAIM sentence:  To say, for example, that there was no evidence to implicate other journalists (which, in any event, although the expressed view of DCS Williams did not, in my judgment, start to be an accurate analysis of the material available to the police), is not the same as saying that the decision not to go further was based on the resource commitment involved

CLAIM sentence:  A careful study of the decision log, the statements and interviews (which contained, for example, the references to other possible victims) would, however, have revealed a rather different picture to that which he had been given during the briefing

CLAIM sentence:  If what records there were had been available, rather more detail might have come back to mind

CLAIM sentence:  I understand the reasons but it reveals an important flaw in what was happening on that day

CLAIM sentence:  Without undertaking a full scale review, in the light of the challenge to the MPS itself, it would have been sensible and responsive to the allegations in the article to ask a number of questions

CLAIM sentence:  He included in his list of principles the Scale, scope and outcome, in terms of the original case, Any complexities and challenges around the evidence then and any advice they have provided and The level of disclosure and who had reviewed what material

CLAIM sentence:  He might also have learnt that, although the terrorism threat fully justified limiting what was to be done in Caryatid, there was an entirely reasonable view that there had been a number of viable leads that could have been pursued had the investigation continued

CLAIM sentence:  Given that the CPS was only asked to consider the investigation actually undertaken and that the purpose of reviewing unused material is limited, the nature of the allegations made by the Guardian meant that this approach was plainly insufficient

CLAIM sentence:  I am simply not in a position to say whether he would have reached a different conclusion

CLAIM sentence:  The action points of the Gold Group meeting on  July simply did not include a review of the papers in storage or the decision logs

CLAIM sentence:  Although DCS Williams went on to retrieve the papers and write a paper with DCS Surtees, the course had been set and a public denunciation of the Guardian delivered

CLAIM sentence:  Whatever emerged when the papers were retrieved and the decision logs reviewed, it is difficult to see how the MPS would have been able to move away from the decision so quickly and so publicly announced

CLAIM sentence:  This is borne out by the minutes of the Gold Group meeting which suggest that the police were more astute to manage aspects of public relations than to review the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  As the MPS has accepted, the exercise was framed too narrowly and the decision had all the hallmarks of haste and none of reflective calm

CLAIM sentence:  It was just why could you not have gone back with all those allegations and looked further into what was what did the material actually say? 

CLAIM sentence:  It has also been scrutinised in detail by both the CPS and leading Counsel

CLAIM sentence:  This statement was inaccurate

CLAIM sentence:  It is known now that neither the CPS, nor Counsel, nor indeed the investigating officers, had examined all the material for evidence of the involvement of other journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Put simply, that is not what happened: the material had not been analysed for evidence incriminating others

CLAIM sentence:  Given the submissions made by DCS Williams on this point, it is quite possible that he provided that assurance but any inquiry would also have revealed that counsel had not been tasked with reviewing the material in order to advise on the extent to which there was evidence of the involvement of others

CLAIM sentence:  Not only had counsel not analysed the material for that purpose: neither had the police

CLAIM sentence:  Both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees have argued that it was their understanding that counsel did examine all the material seized during the investigation and DCS Williams has submitted that it was the responsibility of the CPS both to advise on charges and to assess whether further evidence was required for the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  With respect, the role of counsel is not to act as investigators and, unless specifically so instructed (which is not suggested) it is wholly unrealistic to suggest that it included examining all the material for evidence that might justify further police investigation against anyone not, at that stage, even the subject of any focused investigation

CLAIM sentence:  When explaining why no further investigative steps were taken in , the officers gave clear evidence that pursuing the investigation would have required a comprehensive analysis of the documents seized and that such an analysis would have been an enormous undertaking and not a straightforward exercise

CLAIM sentence:  Analysing the material would have required a time-consuming and systematic analysis of the papers, with the need to create schedules and spreadsheets of the material in order to cross-reference all the information

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates also addressed in the press statement the question of the number of victims of unlawful voicemail interception: Their potential targets may have run into hundreds of people, but our inquiries showed that they only used the tactic against a far smaller number of individuals

CLAIM sentence:  Given the discoveries that Operation Caryatid had made, these statements were also wholly inaccurate

CLAIM sentence:  The fact that a substantive offence could not be made out for purely technical reasons would not give the potential targets comfort in terms of measuring the level of intrusion to their privacy but it should also be reiterated that the commission of a criminal offence under the CMA did not depend for its proof on the precise timing of the interception

CLAIM sentence:  There was strong evidence that they had intercepted  Royal family aides phones and a further  other high profile people, all of which were subject to the charges and proceedings in court

CLAIM sentence:  Wider people were not informed as there was no evidence to suggest there was any criminal activity on their phones

CLAIM sentence:  I totally understand that there is a different view on that now

CLAIM sentence:  It also appears therefore that DCS Williams erroneously put forward the need to apply the narrow interpretation of s of RIPA as one of the reasons why the investigation was not widened in 

CLAIM sentence:  Both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees have submitted that counts  to  were contained on the indictment in order to test the law

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams said this was agreed by the CPS and Counsel to see if the convictions could be secured despite having no proof that an interception had taken place

CLAIM sentence:  There is no doubt that DCS Williams misunderstood or failed accurately to remember the more nuanced advice given by Counsel in August  at the conference he attended and that DCS Surtees acquired the same misunderstanding

CLAIM sentence:  The first was that he appeared to give less credence to the allegations than they deserved simply because they were made in a newspaper article

CLAIM sentence:  The second is the defensive mind-set alluded to above

CLAIM sentence:  It was an article in a newspaper, and it was no more, no less than that

CLAIM sentence:  It was an article in a newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  Events make that look very different, I know, but give me the credit, this was an article in a newspaper, thats what it was about

CLAIM sentence:  It wasnt a formal review

CLAIM sentence:  That absence caused the Met to be more and more convinced that the original investigation, therefore was a success in totality, and of course that wasnt the case what we didnt do is go back and actually challenge the reasons for those decisions in  We didnt go back and challenge the reasons why it was limited because we didnt know that it was limited, and had that taken place, we might have been in a better place I then go on to think that we got ourselves almost hooked on a strategy on a defensive strategy that we would not expend significant resources without new or additional evidence the defensive mindset we established was very much based on the flawed assumption that the original one was successful investigation in totality and the absence of challenge, I think, led us into some difficulty, if that makes sense

CLAIM sentence:  This attitude prevented him from standing back from the article and assessing its allegations dispassionately, despite the fact that this is what he had been given the responsibility for doing

CLAIM sentence:  The article was not tittle-tattle

CLAIM sentence:  On its face it was a well-researched piece of journalism

CLAIM sentence:  It was significant that three years had passed but the matter remained of real interest to a credible journalist

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, the then Home Secretary, Rt Hon Alan Johnson MP, said in evidence that at the ACPO conference on  July the first conversation he had with Sir Paul Stephenson, in a quiet corner, was about the article

CLAIM sentence:  The defensive mind-set outlined by Sir Paul Stephenson also largely explains the approach taken by DCS Williams

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams accepted in evidence that his response to the article was influenced or indeed governed by his perception that the Guardian was alleging that the police had tried to hide something: maybe its the wrong perception, my feeling was that they were very much saying we were trying to hide something, so my thats my impression from the coverage, and Im trying to say there was absolutely no intention to hide anything

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams has since accepted specifically that he was defensive but denies that this prevented him from carrying out an open minded and dispassionate re-evaluation of the decisions taken

CLAIM sentence:  I regret that I do not agree

CLAIM sentence:  Being open-minded would have led to his appreciation that there were, indeed, other potential victims and other evidence to examine (as he has accepted that he knew) with the result that there was sufficient in the article to justify rather more detailed consideration than the few hours it was given

CLAIM sentence:  If he had remembered the pressure on resources at the time, being open-minded would have led him back to the papers not to re-open the investigation but to put himself in the best position to analyse the criticisms made of the police

CLAIM sentence:  Im thinking of it in my head as the evidence I didnt have in my mind of what I would have needed to take that investigation forward, and if Ive created the wrong impression, Ive created the wrong impression

CLAIM sentence:  It wasnt done intentionally

CLAIM sentence:  Im trying to provide a briefing to my senior officer as genuinely as possible as to what we did and what we didnt do then

CLAIM sentence:  Im saying I havent made these decisions I accept Im responsible, I was the SIO, no question about that, but I havent done it in isolation, I have briefed and talked to a whole range of people and I always do that for the purpose of taking advice and talking things through

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately my decision as SIO where we go with that in the parameters Ive been given with the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  I understand what youre saying, but I was not doing anything here to mislead or create a false impression

CLAIM sentence:  The briefing DCS Williams gave was clearly inaccurate and, as set out above, by , he appeared to have formed the belief that there was no evidence in police possession that then could or should be taken forward as part of a further investigation

CLAIM sentence:  It is unnecessary for me to attempt to make a finding on how he may have come to hold this belief, despite his contrary understanding in 

CLAIM sentence:  Related to the question about the extent to which the Guardian article merited detailed consideration, Mr Yates was asked to explain why he did not wait for DCS Williams to provide him with briefing notes before issuing his press statement

CLAIM sentence:  He said: wed established the facts and the facts were, then, that that Guardian article had some new information for the general public, but it wasnt new to the investigators or to the police, and there was nothing there was no new evidence presented by that article to warrant reopening the investigation at that stage

CLAIM sentence:  The Guardian was alleging that the evidence should have been acted upon

CLAIM sentence:  It does not appear to have crossed his mind to ask DCS Williams for full details of what information there was that might possibly implicate other journalists

CLAIM sentence:  The fact of the matter was, as I was briefed, there was nothing else in that article that led us to suggest that anything else needed to be done immediately regarding the investigation, or anything about the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the very fact of the pressure caused by counter terrorism operations could have alerted those looking back from  to perceive the risk that a decision had been taken at least in part on the basis that, whatever else the material might reveal if further time was spent on it, there were far more pressing operational demands that took priority

CLAIM sentence:  He was asked if he saw the relevance of the obstruction from that point of view

CLAIM sentence:  His answer was: I do and I dont

CLAIM sentence:  This statement was made not only in response to media comment, but also in response to a letter received that day from Lord Prescott (then the Rt Hon John Prescott MP)

CLAIM sentence:  An action point recorded in the minutes was that DCS Williams was to confirm the position; it noted: If he had been subject to interception and evidence supported this then he would have been informed ACTION PW to confirm

CLAIM sentence:  It also indicates that they did not have in mind that whether someone was a potential victim was as important as whether someone could be proved to be a victim, given that the investigation had not been exhaustive, and ignored the prospect that the individual was a victim of an offence under the CMA or the target of a conspiracy

CLAIM sentence:  He therefore convened a meeting at which he asked senior lawyers to conduct an examination of the material supplied to the CPS by the police so that he could be satisfied that appropriate action had been taken at the time

CLAIM sentence:  He also asked for a chronology, setting out the actions taken and the sources of information

CLAIM sentence:  Simultaneously, the office of the DPP came under pressure from the Home Secretary and the press to explain the nature of its involvement in : all this demonstrates the extent to which the allegation in the Guardian was not just another article

CLAIM sentence:  This was some of the first information he received and: given his position at the time, I have  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In light of the fresh allegations that have been made, some preliminary enquiries have been undertaken and I have now ordered an urgent examination of the material that was supplied to the CPS by the police three years ago

CLAIM sentence:  I am taking this action to satisfy myself and assure the public that the appropriate actions were taken in relation to that material

CLAIM sentence:  Given the nature of the offences, the amount of material is of course extensive and complex, but it has all been located and a small team is now rapidly working through it

CLAIM sentence:  This process will need to be thorough, so it will necessarily take some time

CLAIM sentence:  I am only too aware of the need for urgency and I will issue a further statement as soon as this work has been completed

CLAIM sentence:  I anticipate being in a position to do so in coming days

CLAIM sentence:  This underlines the point made above: by its very nature, unused material is only examined for the purpose of disclosing material that might undermine a prosecution case or assist the defence in a prosecution being mounted

CLAIM sentence:  This time DCS Surtees was also present

CLAIM sentence:  Effective use of Police resources was also considered at the time and discretion to investigate (R v Blackburn)

CLAIM sentence:  The data examined did not unravel a conspiracy with other journalists so was not extended

CLAIM sentence:  It is also worthy to note that the victims subject to interception, apart from the two convicted defendants, they did not have any other suspect / target numbers attempting to intercept their phones

CLAIM sentence:  I am driven to the conclusion that having reached his dogmatic conclusion the previous day, he had closed his mind to the question of whether there might be material in police possession that could justify reopening the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees has submitted further evidence in which he states that the minutes of  July  were not a wholly accurate reflection of what was discussed and that in this meeting and subsequent meetings he attended, he was vocal in advancing his view that the matter should be re-opened and re-investigated for the very reason that he knew there were evidential leads to pursue and that the rationale for closing the investigation in  did not exist in 

CLAIM sentence:  It is appropriate next to refer to the fact that, on  July , an article written by Andy Hayman was published in The Times

CLAIM sentence: pdf  p, lines -, ibid  Second witness statement of Keith Surtees is available on the Inquiry website  Second witness statement of Philip Williams is available on the Inquiry website  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcrelevant papers or decision logs

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams believed that the briefing note may well have included more detail than he gave orally on  July: particularly when it goes into quoting figures, because then we had retrieved the investigative documents from storage and so I would have been able to do that

CLAIM sentence:  On the day, I would of  July, I would have been doing it to the best of my ability of my memory

CLAIM sentence:  On some there are names which probably relate to journalists and cash sums

CLAIM sentence:  It was also claimed in the briefing note that: All the available evidence in terms of scale and potential role of News of the World  p, line , Andy Hayman, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of what he has recently argued, it is surprising that DCS Surtees did not ensure that this was communicated in the written document

CLAIM sentence:  When taken to these paragraphs of the briefing note, he said that they didnt hit home in that way

CLAIM sentence:  I find that this reference to evidence implicating other journalists did not hit home precisely because of his closed and defensive mind-set, which caused him to overlook the significance of these paragraphs

CLAIM sentence:  I do not pass further comment or reach any further conclusions, however, not least because of the current criminal investigations and impending prosecutions of other journalists at NoTW and my anxiety not to prejudice let alone appear to prejudge what might emerge at any trial

CLAIM sentence:   It is suggested that no evidence in this context does not mean there were no lines of investigation or no suspicion of criminality but that they did not have available at that time sufficient evidence to charge other people

CLAIM sentence:  The following is also recorded in the briefing note: Advice indicated that S RIPA interception or Computer Misuse Act might be the potential offences for what was happening

CLAIM sentence:  This indicates that DCS Williams had refreshed his memory from the papers sufficiently to recall that voicemail interception was not just an offence under RIPA but also under the CMA

CLAIM sentence:  Further, at paragraph  of the briefing note DCS Williams and DCS Surtees recorded that the victim strategy, in broad terms, had been to inform everyone in the bluebook who had had their unique voicemail access number dialled by the suspects

CLAIM sentence:  That meeting dealt predominantly with the question of ensuring that the MPS had been sufficiently diligent in informing potential victims but there was also discussion about whether a letter should be written to the Guardian encouraging the newspaper to share any new information

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes stated: Following DPA advice, JY decided not to write a letter as the Guardian to date had not produced any fresh information or evidence in their articles

CLAIM sentence:  Their articles were based on historical cases

CLAIM sentence:  If he did, the Guardian could use spin and claim that he has made a U-turn, had done this under mounting pressure, why was this not done before etc

CLAIM sentence:  Press reporting to be monitored in event fresh information comes to light to justify writing a letter

CLAIM sentence:  The second Gold Group meeting was attended only by MPS personnel, including DCS Williams and DCS Surtees

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  the journalist Nick Davies, who had been responsible for the Guardian article, gave evidence to the CMS Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Also on  July  David Perry QC and Louis Mably produced the note to which reference has already been made (see paragraph 

CLAIM sentence:  The key part of the note was the following: We did enquire of the police at the conference whether there was any evidence that the editor of the News of the World was involved in the Goodman-Mulcaire offences

CLAIM sentence:  And: Well, if you read out the sentence in the note, I think its abundantly clear whats there, and on any reading, exculpatory, CPIA or whatever, they are saying theyve done the exercise on CPIA and they never saw any such evidence about others involvement I cant see any other reading of it that would you know, its there

CLAIM sentence:  On  July , the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee (adding weight to the enquiries being conducted by the CMS Committee) wrote to Sir Paul Stephenson in order to put a serious of questions to the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Also on  July  DCS Williams sent an email to the CPS which contained his recollection of the August  conference with counsel

CLAIM sentence:  It is noteworthy that the press release relates only to those identified to the CPS and reads as follows: Having examined the material that was supplied to the CPS by the police in this case, I can confirm that no victims or suspects other than those referred to above were identified to the CPS at the time

CLAIM sentence:  I am not in a position to say whether the police had any information on any other victims or suspects that was not passed to the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  Also on  July  DCS Williams wrote a report entitled: Why didnt we expand the investigation? in which he stated that: My practical assessment was that no matter what we found out [once the investigation was overt] any other potential suspects were now firmly aware of what we were doing and would certainly be taking all steps to avoid incriminating themselves

CLAIM sentence:  The potential breadth/scale of what may or may not be out there was fully discussed together with what resources  Not published  p, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The report suggests that the decision was made at least predominantly (if not entirely) on the basis of the quality of the evidence and viability of the leads, rather than making clear that resource concerns overrode considerations of the quality of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams also set out his views on what would be the issues should it be decided to now open an investigation into any aspects of NOTW activities from that period: 

CLAIM sentence:  Maximum success already achieved My rationale for what we did then I believe serves as a strong basis for why it would be highly challenging to find anything more that would lead to a criminal prosecution which would have any greater benefit in terms of what we have already achieved

CLAIM sentence:  Data In terms of practical challenges I doubt whether the necessary data exists now

CLAIM sentence:  Even at the time Orange for example only hold what data they had for a few hundred days

CLAIM sentence:  Given that the people who are targeted are in the public eye for one reason or another I suspect many of them would not want to [be] identified publicly as a victim due to what it might suggest about their private life

CLAIM sentence:  Public Duty Taking into consideration all that I have written above I do not feel we would be serving the criminal justice system for the public good, but all we would achieve is feeding the civil litigation industry for individual gain at much cost to the general public

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes also  Not published  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Police could have arrested Thurlbeck and/or others

CLAIM sentence:  The experience police had of the stance taken by News International staff led them to suspect that any other journalists arrested would not readily assist police by answering any questions this would inevitably leave investigators with insufficient evidence to charge others

CLAIM sentence:  For their part, during the course of  July , the CPS ascertained that the for Neville material was part of the unused material and nothing more

CLAIM sentence:  David and Louis asked if evidence editor and other journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Shortly after pm that evening, DCS Williams sent the CPS a briefing note, as they had requested, which he entitled Challenges faced in the investigation and subsequent prosecution for the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  He set out his advice under the heading Draft Advice although it was not expressed to be contingent on any further information or input from either the MPS or the CPS and was never replaced by a further document

CLAIM sentence:  The advice arrived at the CPS at : hrs the following morning, namely  July 

CLAIM sentence:  Given that he did not have his papers and was advising overnight, I am fully prepared to accept the explanation why he expressed this view, despite having given different advice in the conference with the CPS and the police in August 

CLAIM sentence:  He should not have permitted himself to rely almost entirely on a briefing note provided by DCS Williams (whom he did not blame) or to assume that it was accurate or reflected the advice he gave in 

CLAIM sentence:  On  August  DCS Williams provided what he called a very rough draft opening statement for the CMS Committee hearing

CLAIM sentence:  Presumably for the purposes of the CMS Committee hearing, DCS Williams prepared a further briefing note, dated  September , entitled Efforts to pursue investigation with NOTW which including the following information: Post arrest at a case conference between police, CPS and Council [sic] the extent of what we could legally ask for access to through a Production order was discussed and again based on the evidence we had that was deemed highly likely to be limited to the activities of Goodman and potentially Mulcaire in affect [sic] we would not be allowed to do anything that might be looked upon as a fishing exercise

CLAIM sentence:  On  November  the DPP wrote again to the Chairman of the CMS Committee

CLAIM sentence:  He said: It is not necessarily correct to assume that their possession of all this material was for the purposes of interception alone and it is not known what their intentions was [sic] or how they intended to use it

CLAIM sentence:  You know, time has shown that to be and whats happened not the greatest call, but at that time it was the right call, and it wasnt influenced in any way, shape or form by other matters

CLAIM sentence:  I just want to assure you that Ive seen nothing that makes me think that there is anything other than a genuine desire to do a proper investigation and to keep the public informed about whats going on

CLAIM sentence:  That he did not take the Guardian article (or the follow up) seriously enough is beyond doubt but I do not believe that he was acting out of fear of NI, or in a desire to protect Neil Wallis or NI or, indeed, to garner favours from the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  I have considered also the subtler point whether because he knew the personalities of the leaders at the NoTW and had amicable relations with them, he was less prepared to think ill of what they had been doing

CLAIM sentence:  He also gave DCS Surtees the responsibility of confirming, from the files, who the police had informed and when

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees has submitted that this tasking was predicated on the narrow interpretation of victim, namely that a person was only a victim if there was proof that a voicemail message sent or received by him/her was intercepted before it was heard by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  It is very surprising that DCS Surtees has made this submission given that it is wholly at odds with the wording of the original victim notification strategy and the summary of the victim notification strategy that he and DCS Williams gave in the briefing note of  July 

CLAIM sentence:  In the minutes of the second meeting on  July , it was recorded that, over the weekend, the police had informed Andy Coulson that he was a potential victim and that attempts had been made to contact seven others, albeit only one of those seven attempts was successful

CLAIM sentence:  The following was also noted: Over weekend

CLAIM sentence:  JY asked rationale for not informing them now

CLAIM sentence:  Press line should read presently not prepared to discuss (this is personal data)

CLAIM sentence:  It is not clear how DCS Williams reached the conclusion that the original victim notification strategy still stood given the reality that it had substantially failed

CLAIM sentence:  The customers were advised that there may have been an attempt by a third party to access their voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  Vodafone and Orange also replied within the month

CLAIM sentence:  They set out what steps they had taken but neither mentioned having taken any steps to identify or inform potential victims of voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  This was intended to assist the MPS in responding to the growing number of requests for information from individuals who were concerned that their voicemail messages may have been intercepted

CLAIM sentence:  However, no such leads, if identified at all, were brought to the attention of senior officers, and the task of scanning documents was not properly completed

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , having been contacted by Nick Davies for information about whether all potential victims had been informed, Orange wrote to DI Maberly in the following terms: Weve drafted a press statement the part relevant to the issue in question (i

CLAIM sentence:  if we were asked to investigate and contact customers) is: We were not asked nor felt it right to further investigate these customers as this was part of the Police investigation

CLAIM sentence:  We were also advised not to contact these customers as it could jeopardise the investigation and prejudice any subsequent trial

CLAIM sentence:  Let me speak to our legal team / SIO (Senior Investigating Officer), who may have a documented record of the strategy agreed at the time

CLAIM sentence:  Were not disputing that the ball was in our court, just that no specific [italics in original] request was made to investigate and contact 

CLAIM sentence:  On  January , DI Maberly emailed O and Orange, explaining that following a review of material requested by DCS Williams, the police had identified a very small number of people who were a target for interception but who had not been informed of this

CLAIM sentence:  Presumably these were individuals who, pursuant to the victim notification strategy, should have been notified by the police

CLAIM sentence:  We could not say for certain that their voicemail had been intercepted only that there was evidence it had been attempted

CLAIM sentence:  From my memory this was approximately  customers, certainly not more than that number

CLAIM sentence:  We had no information that voicemail messages belonging to any additional customers on the O network had been intercepted or had interception attempted

CLAIM sentence:  This demonstrates that O informed their customers because they made the independent decision to do so and not pursuant to a request from the police

CLAIM sentence:   Emails not published  Not published  Not published  Not published  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xc

CLAIM sentence:  He stated in that letter that: Since that appearance, and in accordance with my initial press statement, I have been attempting to ensure that the police have taken all proper, reasonable and diligent steps to inform all those individuals where there is any evidence that they may have been subject of any form of interception

CLAIM sentence:  This has involved considerable and time consuming work, in particular the use of an IT process previously unavailable

CLAIM sentence:  Even now we cannot with any certainty answer questions relating to identifying individuals and whether or not they were a victim of interception whenever a name in whatever context was identified it was captured and put onto an MPS system

CLAIM sentence:  The name could range from initials, single names right through to multiple variations and spellings of a host of fore and/or surnames

CLAIM sentence:  To even attempt to discern from the material to what extent this data refers to distinct individuals or for what purpose would have required extensive work beyond the scope of the criminal investigation and would not have been a proportionate use of police resources

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams prepared a report entitled Options for Dealing with the potential victims issue

CLAIM sentence:  It is undated, but it is apparent from the content that it was drafted after the MPS received the request issued under the Freedom of Information Act but before the response which was dated  March 

CLAIM sentence:  Option  Police try to contact these people using the mobile numbers listed by Mulcaire and tell them that they fall into this category

CLAIM sentence:  Issues to consider: This case is now nearly  years old, we are not carrying out an investigation and all the time we are spending public money on something that is not making anyone safer

CLAIM sentence:  At best we would be handing someone an opportunity to make personal gain through the civil courts which does not assist the wider public good

CLAIM sentence:  However, it might not be as easy as it seems, because we could be limited in terms of our full range of research methods as this is not an investigation and that could delay notification in some instances

CLAIM sentence:  This is something that could be done immediately, before the Nick Davies FOIA letter goes out

CLAIM sentence:  It was noted in the minutes of a Gold Group meeting on  September  that DCS Williams was to provide a brief on the victim strategy to date

CLAIM sentence:  At a further meeting on  September  the approach for dealing with potential new victims was discussed

CLAIM sentence:  There was also an action point requiring DCS Williams to provide details to JY of notifications to potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS began asking the service providers, in terms, which victims they had contacted and asking them to notify those not yet contacted

CLAIM sentence:  The action continued: If victims remain outstanding consideration of joint letter (MPS and telephone companies) to inform them accordingly

CLAIM sentence:  It was following this meeting that DCS Williams wrote to O, Everything Everywhere (formerly Orange) and Vodafone asking them whether those who they (the phone companies) had identified as potential victims during the  to  investigation had been contacted

CLAIM sentence:  He asked them, if they had not informed those potential victims, to make arrangements to bring to their attention the information that suggested they might have been victims

CLAIM sentence:  He also asked them to provide those customers with the MPS single point of contact

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , Orange responded stating that no Orange customers had been contacted and that at no point during the investigation, or subsequently, had the MPS asked Orange or T-Mobile to contact any potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  The letter also stated: Orange assisted the investigation by providing a list of mobile numbers that had been called by a set of telephone numbers supplied to us by the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Orange has no knowledge if those Orange mobiles were being called legitimately or with the intention of attempting to access their voicemail without authorisation

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , O responded by saying: I can confirm that the O customers identified in  by us as potential victims of voicemail interception were contacted at the time and given advice 

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst we were able to furnish the police with information and data requested, it is not for Vodafone to determine who is a potential victim in a police led investigation This is something for the police to establish and it is for the police to take such steps to inform potential victims of crime as they deem appropriate, which I accept could have included asking Vodafone to contact a given list of customers A search of our files in relation to the matter has not revealed any request from your officers that we do otherwise

CLAIM sentence:  The police thereafter identified that in fact  people out of the list of  names with PIN numbers associated had not yet been contacted

CLAIM sentence:  This resulted in some material not being placed on the system which resulted in incomplete or incorrect responses to a number of people who were affected

CLAIM sentence:  This is a matter of great personal regret

CLAIM sentence:  It should be noted, however, that the process of scanning the documents in order to create a searchable database was not implemented to assist in positively identifying individuals who had not been informed but who should have been; rather it was to respond to individual requests for information from people who wanted confirmation whether or not they were potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  They failed even to realise that the victim notification strategy had failed or the extent of its failure until Orange and Vodafone spelled out in terms that they had not notified their customers, nor been asked to do so

CLAIM sentence:  Any suggestion that further transgressions have occurred since its report was published in  will be investigated without delay

CLAIM sentence:  In the meantime, the PCC is contacting the Guardian newspaper and Information Commissioner for any further specific information in relation to the claims, published today about the older cases, which suggest the Commission has been misled at any stage of its inquiries into these matters

CLAIM sentence:  It launched a further investigation, taking evidence from the NoTW, the Guardian and the Information Commissioners Office

CLAIM sentence: , PCC  hacking report , http://www

CLAIM sentence: , PCC  hacking report, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  He was asked to put to one side what the police might or might not have found

CLAIM sentence:  There was no evidence provided to me to support what the Guardian had said at all

CLAIM sentence:  And I made that clear to the Select Committee I think in July of , I think it was, about its significance But yes, and that clearly, perhaps, was an error, because this letter was dated  August and Id appeared before the Select Committee in the month previously

CLAIM sentence:  So Im sure that the PCC were aware of that, if that clearly that was following my evidence to the Select Committee, which was very heavily covered

CLAIM sentence:  I am afraid that I find this response was unconvincing

CLAIM sentence:  He claimed that Burton Copeland were given:  every financial document which could possibly be relevant to the papers dealings with Mulcaire, and they confirmed that they could find no evidence from these documents or their other enquiries which suggested complicity by the News of the World or other members of its staff beyond Clive Goodman in criminal activities

CLAIM sentence:  As referred to there is no available information about what documents were given to Burton Copeland (beyond certain limited  p, lines -, Colin Myler, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The CMS Committee considered that the Guardian article cast doubt on the evidence they had been given by NI executives in  and so reopened the hearings in the inquiry (launched in November ) into press standards, privacy and libel; the purpose was to examine whether there was any evidence of a widespread conspiracy at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee heard evidence from representatives of the Guardian, the PCC, the Information Commissioner and the MPS as well as from then current and former NI executives

CLAIM sentence:  It also received written evidence from the DPP and Mark Lewis, the solicitor who acted for Gordon Taylor

CLAIM sentence:  The NI witnesses comprised Tom Crone, Colin Myler, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner and Les Hinton

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee decided not to use its powers of compulsion for reasons of time and practicality

CLAIM sentence:  He said:  What we had with the Clive Goodman case was a reporter who deceived the managing editors office and, in turn, deceived me

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Q, CMS Report on Press Standards Privacy and Libel  Q, ibid  Q, ibid  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xca rogue reporter decides to behave in that fashion I am not sure that there is an awful lot more I could have done

CLAIM sentence:  Then I brought in Burton Copeland, an independent firm of solicitors to carry out an investigation

CLAIM sentence:  There was nothing that they asked for that they were not given

CLAIM sentence:  Again, these assertions cannot be tested because legal professional privilege has not been waived in relation to the instructions given to Burton Copeland, the material provided, or, indeed, any aspect of the work done

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee concluded, in their report published on  February , that: Evidence we have seen makes it inconceivable that no-one else at the News of the World, bar Clive Goodman, knew about the phone-hacking We cannot believe that the newspapers newsroom was so out of control for this to be the case

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee also noted that the newspapers enquiries had been far from full or vigorous, as it and the PCC had been assured

CLAIM sentence:  In fact, the NoTW maintained the one rogue reporter defence until the Spring of  when three NoTW journalists were arrested as part of Operation Weeting

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee also considered the actions of the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  I considered the amount of complexities and challenges around the evidence then and what evidence would be available now, particular in relation to the availability of the data

CLAIM sentence:  In this case senior counsel had reviewed the material

CLAIM sentence:  I considered how the case was opened after the guilty pleas

CLAIM sentence:  He said of the Guardian article that: there is essentially nothing new in the story other than to place in the public domain additional material which had already been considered by both the police investigation into Goodman and Mulcaire and by the CPS and the prosecution team

CLAIM sentence:  There was certainly no new evidence and, in spite of a huge amount of publicity and our own request of the Guardian and others to submit to us any additional evidence, nothing has been forthcoming since

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///MPS--Culture-Media-and- Sport-Select-Commitee-report-part-

CLAIM sentence:  These matters merited thorough police investigation, and the first steps to be taken seem to us to have been obvious

CLAIM sentence:  The Metropolitan Polices reasons for not doing so seem to us to be inadequate

CLAIM sentence:  As regard the PCC, the Committee found as follows: We accept that in  the PCC acted in good faith to follow up the implications of the convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  This Committee has not done so and we find the conclusions in the PCCs November report simplistic and surprising

CLAIM sentence:  It has certainly not fully, or forensically, considered all the evidence to this inquiry

CLAIM sentence: \t September\t:\tThe\tNew\tYork\tTimes 

CLAIM sentence:  On  September  the New York Times published an article entitled Tabloid Hack Attack on Royals, and Beyond

CLAIM sentence:  The article reported that, in the summer of , five people had issued claims alleging that the NoTW had been intercepting their voicemail messages; it also referred to the judicial review of the handling by the MPS of the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  The article claimed that: The litigation is beginning to expose just how far the hacking went, something that Scotland Yard did not do

CLAIM sentence:  But Scotland Yard focused almost exclusively on the royals case, which culminated with the imprisonment of Mulcaire and Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  When police officials presented evidence to prosecutors, they didnt discuss crucial clues that the two men may not have been alone in hacking the voice mail messages of story targets

CLAIM sentence:  The article also reported that several investigators had said in interviews that the MPS was reluctant to conduct a wider inquiry in part because of its close relationship with the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  The article alleged that illicit methods of obtaining confidential information were known as the dark arts

CLAIM sentence:  The article also made the following allegations: (a) (b) (c) (d) That in the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire there were at least three names of other NoTW journalists

CLAIM sentence:  That the MPS had a symbiotic relationship with the NoTW: The police sometimes built high-profile cases out of the papers exclusives, and News of the World reciprocated with fawning stories of arrests

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS did not discuss certain evidence with the CPS, including the notes which suggested the involvement of other reporters

CLAIM sentence:  Once again, however, he failed to engage with the substance of what was alleged

CLAIM sentence:  On  September  Mr Yates issued a press statement which included the following: The New York Times contacted the MPS about their investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Our stance remains as before

CLAIM sentence:  We have repeatedly asked them for any new material that they have for us to consider

CLAIM sentence:  We were never made aware of the material from Sean Hoare before the articles publication

CLAIM sentence:  We have sought additional information from them and will  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This is a matter of public record

CLAIM sentence:  Neither DCS Williams nor DCS Surtees were invited to the meeting

CLAIM sentence:  The strands were listed and included New information in the public domain by ex News of the World employees, which relates to Andy Coulson, Sean Hoare, Sharon Marshall, Ross Hall, Brendan Montague and Paul McMullan and New allegations or new material as yet unknown

CLAIM sentence:  DSupt Haydon (as ACSOs former Staff Officer) will lead this separate and independent effort to clarify the above

CLAIM sentence:  Action points required Detective Superintendent Haydon (who had been appointed SIO) to review the transcripts of different statements in the public domain, liaise with the CPS to discuss any new material that might come to light and consider interviewing Sharon Marshall about the statements made in her book

CLAIM sentence:  On  September  D/Supt Haydon sent an email to the CPS setting out the action the MPS was proposing to take following the article

CLAIM sentence:  In his email he said that he had been asked: to clarify the new information in the public domain (since st September ) to establish if there is any new evidence in the phone hacking case I wish to make it clear that I am not reinvestigating the original case so knowledge of the case and retrieving case papers is not necessary

CLAIM sentence:  D/Supt Haydon was directed to define the terms of reference for the work being undertaken and extend the remit to cover additional individuals who were coming forward

CLAIM sentence:  At a meeting of the Gold Group on  September , it was noted that the new witnesses, who had been identified by the New York Times article, would need to be approached as part of Operation Varec

CLAIM sentence:  D/Supt Haydon informed those present that the New York Times had been asked for their material

CLAIM sentence:  The references to JLP reset PIN  and JLP were also brought to his attention but it was suggested to him that, given the surrounding information, they related to Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton

CLAIM sentence:  He was also informed that there were no results for searches on popular media nick-names for Lord Prescott

CLAIM sentence:  He also made it clear that his conclusions in relation to the for Neville email remained unchanged

CLAIM sentence:  On  October , D/Supt Haydon and another officer had a meeting with Simon Clements and Asker Hussain of the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  Following this programme, D/Supt Haydon wrote to Colin Myler asking him to provide relevant material including transcripts of telephone calls or emails that may be related to unlawful interception and a full list of the names of employees who worked on the Features or News desks for the period  to 

CLAIM sentence:  He indicated that they were putting together a list of names which they would forward to him

CLAIM sentence:  That list was emailed by Tom Crone to the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  In that letter D/Supt Haydon explained that he was considering any new material that had come to light as a result of the Dispatches programme and said:  Not published  Not published  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  If you feel you are able to assist, and I stress this is in relation to the issue of phone hacking only, then I request you make contact with me on the contact details provided in this letter

CLAIM sentence:  Id had the meeting back in  where a course of action I thought was reasonably sensible didnt look as if it was going to find favour, and Id been told in September  that whatever else was going to happen, this was not going to be reinvestigated

CLAIM sentence:  The first phase had been to ask the New York Times to provide any material in support of its article

CLAIM sentence:  It was also reported that: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) The police interviewed Sean Hoare under caution in the hope that they could convert his claims and admissions into evidence, but he made no comment

CLAIM sentence:  The police interviewed Sharon Marshall, not under caution, but she did not disclose any new evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The police approached Paul McMullan, a former features journalist at the NoTW, on numerous occasions in order to interview him under caution, but he declined to cooperate

CLAIM sentence:  The police interviewed Brendan Montague, a freelance journalist, not under caution and more as a victim, but he did not disclose any new evidence

CLAIM sentence:  D/Supt Haydon noted that there were no communications data that would support a criminal investigation or prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  He also denied any involvement in voicemail interception and refused to answer any further questions

CLAIM sentence:  Greg Miskiw was interviewed under caution

CLAIM sentence:  The police also sent letters to three supervisors employed by the NoTW who had been named in an anonymous letter

CLAIM sentence:  The police did not receive any responses to the letters

CLAIM sentence:  During phase three, the police wrote to the Producer of the Dispatches programme Tabloid, Tories and Telephone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  In a letter to the MPS dated  October , the Controller of legal and compliance for Channel  wrote: Having discussed the matter further with the producers who have direct dealings with the  individuals, they do not believe that any of the individuals would be prepared to assist your investigation

CLAIM sentence:  I also confirm that having spoken with the producers they do not have any additional evidence that was not included in the broadcast programme that could assist the MPS and that is not already in the public domain

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS also wrote to the editor of the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, the Independent and the NoTW seeking any new or additional material they held that could assist in the MPS investigation

CLAIM sentence:  No new material was forthcoming

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, phase four involved writing to  members of staff still employed by the NoTW (paragraph 

CLAIM sentence:  above refers) to establish if any could assist or provide any information relating to voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  No response was received from any of them

CLAIM sentence:  D/Supt Haydon then set out the following under the heading Conclusion: 

CLAIM sentence:  There is some possible circumstantial evidence but in the absence of any communications data and any other supporting evidence, this cannot be progressed

CLAIM sentence:  I accept that the evidential position does not meet the threshold for a referral to the CPS but in view of the vast media, public and political scrutiny in this case and due to both the MPS and CPS involvement to date, I consider a referral is appropriate in order to agree a joint current and future position in this case 

CLAIM sentence:  He concluded that the case did not pass the evidential stage of the test contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, namely that there must be sufficient evidence to establish that there is a realistic prospect of conviction

CLAIM sentence:  He added that he considered that the available evidence in fact fell well below the evidential threshold for prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  Given the on-going police investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to identify precisely what material had formed  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The answer to this allegation was straightforward: without deciding to re-open Operation Caryatid, look at the material to find out if there is anything in it which bears out what has been alleged

CLAIM sentence: \t December\t:\tThe\tGuardian\tarticle\tand\tthe\t aftermath 

CLAIM sentence:  The Particulars of Claim were based upon documents disclosed to her legal advisers by the MPS following a disclosure application to the High Court

CLAIM sentence:  The article also reported that: The document, which has been released to the Guardian by the high court, suggests that the hacking of the two actors was part of a wider scheme, hatched early in , when Mulcaire agreed to use electronic intelligence and eavesdropping to supply the paper with daily transcripts of the messages of a list of named targets from the worlds of politics, royalty and entertainment

CLAIM sentence:  He also agreed to provide daily transcripts

CLAIM sentence:  The article also alleged that the police had failed to interview four journalists who were implicated by the material already in police possession

CLAIM sentence:  On  January , the Guardian asked the CPS a series of detailed questions about whether or not the CPS had been aware, in , of the evidence that was emerging from the civil action brought by Ms Miller

CLAIM sentence:  At that stage, what he wanted was an examination of all material available at that time, whether in the possession of the police or the CPS, and for some further assistance to be given to him about what consideration was given to it at the time

CLAIM sentence:  The first time was in relation to the Neville email, and now it was happening again in relation to the Sienna Miller material

CLAIM sentence:  And Im afraid at that stage I thought nothing less than a root and branch review of all the material that we have and the police had is now going to satisfy me about this case

CLAIM sentence:  And thats why I indicated in fact to Tim Godwin, who I think was then Acting Commissioner, that I had for my part reached the view that we could no longer approach this on a piecemeal basis looking at bits of material and we really had to roll our sleeves up and look at everything

CLAIM sentence:  The following appeared in notes of the meeting: DH [a police officer]: Op Varec is the only new material in terms of G/M

CLAIM sentence:  The account given by Mr Yates of this meeting had a different emphasis, and suggested that he was, indeed, concerned about how matters had been dealt with and did not simply adopt a refrain that he would act if there were new evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Also on  January  the CPS and the MPS issued a joint press statement to that effect

CLAIM sentence:  On  January , NI provided the MPS with significant new information relating to allegations of voicemail interception at the NoTW in  to , which had apparently been discovered whilst NI was dealing with requests for disclosure in the civil actions

CLAIM sentence:  That same day the MPS announced that it was re-opening its investigation into allegations of unlawful voicemail interception at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Once NI decided to cooperate, the evidential flood gates opened, providing material that had not been made available to the police by Burton Copeland

CLAIM sentence:  I can only repeat that it is impossible to ascertain to what material Burton Copeland had access or what advice they provided

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  the Home Affairs Committee published its report: Unauthorised tapping into or hacking of mobile communications

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, the process was more in the nature of a check as to whether a narrowly-defined inquiry had been done properly and whether any new information was sufficient to lead to that inquiry being re-opened or a new one instigated

CLAIM sentence:  The civil litigation has attracted extensive public interest and attention

CLAIM sentence:  It has also had wider consequences beyond the confines of the claims for damages themselves

CLAIM sentence:  In order to understand the full extent of the interception, recording and use of their voicemail messages, so that they could properly present their claims, the claimants made disclosure applications which required NGN and the MPS to disclose various documents

CLAIM sentence:  As a result of the claim brought by Lord Prescott, the following statement entered the public domain, on  January : On  December  [NGN] admitted a list of matters including that it had entered into an agreement with [Mr Mulcaire] and paid him hundreds of thousands of pounds to obtain information about specific individuals for use by the News of the World journalists and publication in the newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  It is also admitted that [Mr Mulcaire] had provided journalists at The News of the World with information to enable the said journalists themselves to intercept voicemail messages, [NGN] accepted that some information unlawfully obtained by [Mr Mulcaire] was used to enable private investigators employed by the News of the World, including Derek Webb, to monitor, locate and track individuals and place them under surveillance

CLAIM sentence:  All four contacted the MPS asking whether this was the case

CLAIM sentence:  By letter dated  February , he requested further details having received information from his service provider to the effect that, in about December , there had been three unlawful attempts to intercept his communications

CLAIM sentence:  The first intimation that this was not the case came in December 

CLAIM sentence:  His concerns were generalised, rather than being based upon any specific incident or report

CLAIM sentence:  The claim for judicial review was issued on or around  September 

CLAIM sentence:  On  May  the application for permission to proceed with a claim by way of judicial review came before the Administrative Court

CLAIM sentence:  The following declaration was agreed between the parties: In breach of its duties under Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights, in circumstances where the interference with the individuals right to respect for their private lives may have amounted to the commission of a criminal offence, the defendant failed to take prompt, reasonable and proportionate steps to ensure that those identified as potential victims of voicemail interceptions were made aware of: The interference with their right to respect for private life that may have occurred; The possibility of continuing threats, where such threats had been identified; The steps they might take to protect their privacy; and Following the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman, the identity of those whom the police believed to be primarily responsible for the interception

CLAIM sentence:  Such steps should have included informing the public generally, by announcements in the media, through the mobile telephone companies, or otherwise (and should have included, where appropriate, individual notification

CLAIM sentence:  The declaration came before the court (Gross LJ and Irwin J) for approval

CLAIM sentence:  Given the circumstances (namely a desire by both parties, for their own reasons, to settle the claim, together with the absence of argument as to the law), the Court made the agreed declaration but, at the same time, directed that it had no value as a precedent for future cases

CLAIM sentence:   A claim for judicial review cannot proceed unless the Administrative court grants permission to proceed

CLAIM sentence:  Important convictions followed, this criminality was brought to the attention of the public and mobile phone companies were prompted to improve their security systems

CLAIM sentence:  Having decided, albeit for irreproachable reasons, not to investigate journalists other than Clive Goodman, it was imperative that the reasons for the decision were fully and accurately recorded and, furthermore, that the police devise, institute and execute a suitable strategy to deal with the many unresolved issues surrounding the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  It is unnecessary to say more about the former (although it might have assisted years later when the Operation came to be revisited)

CLAIM sentence:  As to the latter, the police rightly identified that potential victims of voicemail interception needed to be informed and it was intended to devise a proportionate and cost-effective strategy

CLAIM sentence:  Third, the exit strategy ought also to have given some thought to advising senior management at the NoTW and NI, about their position and the reasons for the curtailment of the investigation not least so that management could consider whether (and if so, what) steps should be taken to improve corporate governance in this area

CLAIM sentence:  When NI and the NoTW declared that there was just one rogue reporter, however, consideration should have been given to the extent to which silence on the part of the MPS provided implicit support for the claim

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, what can be said is that there was a failure on the part of the management at the NoTW to drill down into the facts to answer the myriad of questions that could have been asked and which could be encompassed by the all embracing question (whether or not it was in fact asked) what the hell was going on? This is a significant finding in the context of the practices of this newspaper at least; whether it can now be said by the press generally that it was a case of one rogue newspaper is another matter

CLAIM sentence:  This was notwithstanding the fact that a vast amount of documentation available from the August  seizures had not been fully analysed by the MPS itself; very little of it had been considered (let alone reviewed) by the CPS, save only for the very limited exercise of disclosure of unused material

CLAIM sentence:  There was a failure to appreciate that the determinative reason for closing the investigation down in September  was not the quality of the evidence but an operational assessment of competing demands on the resources of SO and the impact of counter terrorism generally and the limited comparative value in further pursuing the matter compared to the input that would have been required

CLAIM sentence:  I am not in doubt that the reaction of the MPS to the Guardian article published on  and  July  was wholly inadequate

CLAIM sentence:  Further, he did not engage with the substance of the allegations or scrutinise the information he was given

CLAIM sentence:  Then, having reached his dogmatic conclusion on  July , he closed his mind to the question of whether there might be material in police possession that could justify reopening the investigation and clung over-tenaciously to the shibboleth no new evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Varec in , (following the article in the New York Times) took the same path

CLAIM sentence:  The only steps taken were aimed at obtaining new evidence, including seeking interviews with those to whom the article referred, requesting material from the New York Times and other titles and information from NoTW reporters: there was no question even of scoping the exercise of looking at the material that had been in the possession of the police for four years

CLAIM sentence:  Unfairly and tendentiously he was placing both organisations in the same boat, when plainly they were occupying different vessels

CLAIM sentence:  The judgment of DCS Williams was also clouded by his defensiveness

CLAIM sentence:  Rather than conducting a thorough review of his decision-making, DCS Williams simply adopted the position that there was no evidence to implicate any other journalists without making clear that although there had not been sufficient evidence to charge any other journalists, there was circumstantial evidence that had generated further lines of enquiry and therefore that the Guardian was right to the extent that there was material in police possession that could have been acted upon

CLAIM sentence:  There was simply no reason for not, at any time, providing the explanation that this additional work was not undertaken because of an operational decision essentially consequent upon intense counter terrorism duties

CLAIM sentence:  At its highest, he mischaracterised what was available and mis-recollected or misunderstood the effect of the legal advice which had been received

CLAIM sentence:  I must also make clear that I find no evidence to suggest that DCS Williams was influenced in any way by the fact that the object of this investigation had been the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  As he had done in , if required, he would have been fully prepared to pursue any investigation as far as it could be taken

CLAIM sentence:  Neither is there any question of his seeking to curry favour with the press or of him having regard to what might have been considered the overly close social relationships of some senior officers with senior members of the press

CLAIM sentence:  There is no doubt that the manner in which the MPS remained implacable in the face of increasingly strident allegations in the press and demonstrated an unwillingness to revisit the investigation fuelled a legitimate concern that influence was at work

CLAIM sentence:  It is not surprising that in the years that have followed there should have developed a belief that relationships between NI and senior figures within the MPS had become so inappropriately close that the integrity of decision-making by the MPS could not be trusted

CLAIM sentence:  Public concern would have been reinforced by the ill-judged article written by Mr Hayman and published in the Times on  July 

CLAIM sentence:  It was also not surprising that the claim for judicial review should follow

CLAIM sentence:  The conduct of the CPS and counsel in relation to the prosecution of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire cannot be criticised

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of the material provided by the police, they advised on an entirely appropriate strategy of targeted prosecution which was pursued effectively to conviction

CLAIM sentence:  Given the allegation that the CPS had not pursued all possible charges those enquiries naturally focused on the material with which the CPS had been provided and the decisions that prosecutors had been required to make

CLAIM sentence:  Going further, however, the CPS in general and the DPP in particular were hampered by the fact that all relevant key personnel had since left the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  The inevitable diminution of memories by the lapse of time, not surprisingly made them reliant on briefing notes from the MPS and the review was not assisted by the failure to examine witness statements and exhibits from the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  It was, however, correct to conclude that the original prosecution had been conducted properly

CLAIM sentence:  It was difficult for the DPP to go behind the note prepared by counsel that they were told that there was no evidence connecting Glenn Mulcaire to other journalists but the press release (I am not in a position to say whether the police had any information on any other victims or suspects that was not passed to the CPS) was entirely fair

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers also headed Operations Elveden and Tuleta

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Elveden began on  June  following the MPS being handed by NI a number of documents containing evidence relating to alleged inappropriate payments to a small number of police officers by journalists at the NoTW in exchange for confidential information

CLAIM sentence:  Since its early stages however, the ambit of Operation Elveden has widened significantly: additional print titles are now being investigated, as well as a range of public officials

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Tuleta commenced as a scoping exercise in June  to consider the possibility of investigating allegations of computer hacking at the NoTW falling outside the remit of Operations Elveden and Tuleta

CLAIM sentence:  In due course it became a fully-fledged investigation, and again its scope has broadened considerably

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers attended the Inquiry on  and  February, and  July , to provide updates as to the current status of these three operations

CLAIM sentence:  On each occasion she helpfully provided a witness statement which she elaborated in oral evidence

CLAIM sentence:  On  October  DAC Akers filed a fourth witness statement which brings the position as up to date as it can be

CLAIM sentence:  She was not asked to give oral evidence in line with that statement

CLAIM sentence:  This section of the Report is heavily based on her evidence, as well as other material which is in the public domain

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Weeting As at  February  there were  officers including support staff dedicated to Operation Weeting; of these, approximately  worked full time in relation to notifying and supporting the victims

CLAIM sentence:  Subsequently, however, Operation Weeting acquired possession of substantial quantities of email data from a variety of sources

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers has informed the Inquiry that: weve rebuilt experts have rebuilt material that we thought had been lost, and that was completed towards the end of November last year

CLAIM sentence:  So were now going through that material

CLAIM sentence:  The first arrest carried out under Operation Weeting was in April , and the last (to date) at the end of August 

CLAIM sentence:   individuals have been arrested for conspiring to intercept communications and/or in relation to the substantive offence

CLAIM sentence:  Of these, seven former NoTW employees have been charged with an overarching, general offence of conspiracy to intercept communications, and an additional former employee has also been charged with a number of date-specific substantive offences

CLAIM sentence:  A provisional court date has been fixed for  September 

CLAIM sentence:  Of the  arrested, six individuals have been released from police bail with no further action taken; the remaining three individuals remain on police bail for conspiracy offences

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear that Operation Weeting has expended a considerable amount of police manpower and resource

CLAIM sentence:  It is also clear that its work has not finished

CLAIM sentence:  Eight individuals have been arrested for perverting the course of justice: this operation has been named Operation Sacha

CLAIM sentence:  Seven of these have been charged with conspiring to commit that offence, and have been sent to the Crown Court for trial

CLAIM sentence:  A hearing for the defendants applications to dismiss is scheduled for  and  December 

CLAIM sentence:  The arrests made thus far under Operation Elveden are for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act , misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to commit these offences, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, money laundering contrary to s of the Proceeds of Crime Act , and bribery contrary to s of the Bribery Act ; the gravamen of the allegations being that they offered money to public officials in exchange for stories

CLAIM sentence:  As at  October  files had been submitted to the CPS to advise on appropriate charges for three public officials and four current and former journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Tuleta began with an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the hacking into computers of Ian Hurst by or at the instigation of NoTW journalists in 

CLAIM sentence:  In April , officers working on Operation Tuleta discovered inconsistencies with regard to the origin of material they had received from the Management Standards Committee (MSC)

CLAIM sentence:  It appears from some of the documentation, and thats dated around late , that one of the mobile phones has been examined with a view to breaking its code, its security code, so that the contents can be downloaded by experts

CLAIM sentence:  Officers working on Operation Tuleta are anticipating the identification of the individuals responsible for the download of the content of these stolen devices, and are also seeking to establish whether the downloading of stolen data may have been a common practice at the other NI titles

CLAIM sentence:  As at  October ,  arrests had been made under the Computer Misuse Act , and/or in respect of offences of handling stolen goods, by officers working on Operation Tuleta

CLAIM sentence:  As with Operations Weeting and Elveden, it is clear that there is considerable potential for further arrests of journalists, and not merely those previously employed by the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Payments to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire might have ensured their silence but a number of the victims were prepared to invest in legal proceedings both to learn precisely what had happened and to obtain redress

CLAIM sentence:  Very substantial further payments in settlement did not stem the tide and, although most of the press was entirely silent on the subject, the effect of the July  story in the Guardian (quite apart from the approach of the police) was to generate enquiry in Parliament, press coverage in the New York Times and the fact (and yet further risk) of an exponential rise in litigation

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of what had emerged in the UK, it is not surprising that while NI (and, to a lesser extent, News Corp) is subject to investigation in the UK, government and regulators in the USA have also been concerned to look at what had been happening

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Elveden, investigating the allegations of police corruption, has been operating under the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission  http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/press_releases/management_ and_standards

CLAIM sentence: com/corp_gov/MSC_faqs

CLAIM sentence: com/corp_gov/msc

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS investigations have focused on the UK subsidiary, NI, and although the MSC is cooperating with enforcement agencies in both the USA and the UK, the investigatory remit of the MSC is restricted to only NI titles and matters in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  It has also assisted in relation to the evidence gathering related to the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  As well as the Committees investigatory functions, the MSC is also responsible for recommending and overseeing the implementation of new policies and systems at NI titles

CLAIM sentence:  As such, he has provided an independent assessment of any applications received for compensation claims made against NGN by those whose voicemails had allegedly been intercepted

CLAIM sentence:  The Scheme has also promised an uplift of % in respect of potential payments, based on what victims might expect if they successfully settled in the courts

CLAIM sentence:  NGN is responsible for reimbursing the costs incurred by the MPS in providing those who apply with appropriate disclosure; it also meets the legal advisory costs of any alleged victims joining the Scheme

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Deborah-Glass

CLAIM sentence: com/corp_gov/MSC_news_

CLAIM sentence:  The autonomy of the MSC has been the cornerstone of the collaboration between the MSC and all those working on the ongoing investigations into the allegations of wrongdoing at NI

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, DAC Akers has praised the levels of assistance and cooperation demonstrated by the MSC, as well as its cooperation in providing information which has been requested by officers conducting the three MPS investigations

CLAIM sentence:  It is also perhaps illustrative of the MSCs approach to the matters of investigation, that the Committee initiated internal reviews of The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times without specific requests from the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  To a certain extent, the MPS has been dependent on the cooperation of the MSC in relation to the disclosure of information; although cooperation is exactly what the police would expect from any corporate body where evidence of criminality has been revealed

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, some of this coverage has led to complaints from current journalists at The Sun, particularly concerning the circumstances and scale of the arrests

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example, following the arrests on  February , the associate editor of The Sun, Trevor Kavanagh, claimed that a disproportionately large number of police officers had been involved in the dawn arrests of journalists at their homes and in The Sun offices, representing a witch hunt and an attack on press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers has also told the Inquiry that there was a time when the attitude of the MSC to the MPS changed somewhat

CLAIM sentence:  Following the arrests of  January  and  February , DAC Akers said that the approach of the MSC to the disclosure of evidence was different:  We were being asked perhaps to justify our requests to a degree that we perhaps formerly hadnt been, and the material that we were requesting was slower in being forthcoming

CLAIM sentence:  This change of behaviour occurred at a time of increased publicity for both the MPS and the MSC, against a backdrop of threats of legal action against the MSC and also when changes were made to the senior personnel at the MSC, which might themselves have contributed to the different relationship between the MSC and the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  It might also be said to be an attempt to enforce the criminal law which other commentators have complained is the true reason (rather than press misconduct) for the present Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of the experience that officers had of journalists when seeking to execute a search warrant during the course of Operation Caryatid, this may not be as surprising as otherwise it might seem

CLAIM sentence:  More specifically, DAC Akers has referred to a period in May  when, for a number of weeks, the MSC temporarily halted the voluntary disclosure of material to the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  This has involved a changed format to meetings between the MSC and MPS teams, and, notably, the insistence on legal representation by the MSC while liaising with officers from the MPS operations

CLAIM sentence:  Material provided by the MSC is for the MPS to assess, evaluate and follow up as appropriate

CLAIM sentence:  The MSC has made clear that it has a duty to protect journalistic sources used by the NI titles and it is careful to ensure that these are not compromised through disclosure

CLAIM sentence:  Where disclosed material might enable the identification of confidential but legitimate sources of information, the MSC has provided such documentation in redacted form

CLAIM sentence:  All such material has been categorised in order to determine whether and what redactions should apply

CLAIM sentence:  To this end, DAC Akers has explained the detail of the process of receiving documents relating to the allegations of alleged payments to public officials

CLAIM sentence:  In such circumstances, documents which, in the first instance, have been redacted to remove confidential material, are provided to officers working on Operation Elveden

CLAIM sentence:  However, if, following this disclosure, the assessment of the evidence by the MPS provides a proper justification for identifying the source, the MSC will provide the information, this time in an unredacted form

CLAIM sentence:  Separately, it also contains material relevant to Operation Tuleta, which is now investigating over  separate allegations of data intrusion

CLAIM sentence:  The documentation provided has been sourced from previous inquiries, as well as the review of  electronic storage devices which were seized during both Operations Weeting and Elveden

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Akers has said that the evidence gathered amounted to between eight and twelve terabytes of data

CLAIM sentence:  Material of real significance has also been disclosed by the MSC to officers working on Operation Elveden, which appears to indicate that not only were routine payments made to public officials by some journalists working at the NoTW but that similar payments had also been made by the employees of The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  In her oral evidence, DAC Akers said that: There also appears to have been a culture at the Sun of illegal payments, and systems have been created to facilitate those payments, whilst hiding the identity of the officials receiving the money

CLAIM sentence:  The emails indicate that payments to sources were openly referred to within the Sun, in which case the source is not named, but rather the category public official is identified, rather than the name

CLAIM sentence:  The consequence of this disclosure by the MSC has led the police to the investigation of those to whom payments were made

CLAIM sentence:  This has revealed evidence to suggest that the practice of payments to public officials, including police officers, may have taken place at other titles outside the NI titles

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS now believes that a number of stories published in the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, the Daily Star and the Star on Sunday, were obtained through such payments

CLAIM sentence:  As a consequence of this disclosure, an employee of TMG and an employee of the Express were arrested by officers working on Operation Elveden

CLAIM sentence:  This has led the police to seek the assistance of both those groups, requesting evidential material relating to these arrests

CLAIM sentence:  Although not relevant to the MSC, it is appropriate here to note that TMG and the Express have taken different approaches to the requests for information requests from the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Brian Paddick, a former Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the MPS, has raised doubts over the ability of the MSC to conduct an impartial and transparent investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He expressed concerns that the MSC might withhold potential evidence from the MPS, particularly as the disclosure of material is voluntary, noting that reliance has been placed on cooperation rather than a production order sought pursuant to the legislative powers set out in PACE

CLAIM sentence:  What information are they not volunteering that Sue Akers is not aware of? He also suggested that the MSC had an advantage in so far that it was potentially able to withhold material from the MPS investigations, by claiming journalistic privilege:  pp-, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  If that committee decides that actually, as far as theyre concerned, theres no criminal implications, that it is subject to journalistic privilege, then that committee does not reveal the information that the police are asking for

CLAIM sentence:  He expressed reservations at the putative neutrality of the MPS, explaining that he feared that public perceptions risked becoming skewed by the fact that the investigation into the alleged corruption of MPS officers was being conducted by the very police force under investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He has suggested that an external police force, one which was not implicated in the current investigations, should have been appointed independently to investigate the alleged wrongdoing which has taken place

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that: some people may not be convinced by the current arrangements and it may be better if it was an outside force who were investigating, purely from a public perception point of view

CLAIM sentence:  Whether they would be better at it, I dont know, but in terms of public perception, Im saying that it might be better

CLAIM sentence:  Specifically, he was concerned at what could happen should the MPS investigations, or the MSC reviews of the NI titles, uncover evidence which placed either party in an unfavourable position in the public eye

CLAIM sentence:  He also expressed his concerns about the independence of the IPCC but did not elaborate further

CLAIM sentence:  As testament to the important contribution that the MSC has made to the investigation, DAC Akers noted that, as at the date of her fourth witness statement, namely  October , the disclosure of material to Operation Elveden had led to the arrest of  journalists out of a total of  arrests; this was in addition to  arrests made as part of Operation Weeting and  arrests as part of Operation Tuleta

CLAIM sentence:  In forming a view about these matters, I am primarily reliant on the evidence provided by DAC Akers (about whom nobody has spoken other than in terms of the highest praise) although I also have professional experience of Lord Grabiner and knowledge of his high standing as an independent barrister in England and Wales

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, I am able to draw inferences from the nature and extent of what has happened as events have unfolded

CLAIM sentence:  Equally, albeit without resolving the present differences between the MPS and the MSC, I have seen no evidence to undermine the view expressed by DAC Akers as to the independence of the MSC and its effectiveness as an independent arbiter in accordance with its remit

CLAIM sentence:  Rupert Murdoch, in an address to NI staff, has been quoted in relation to the findings of the reviews of The Times and The Sunday Times, saying there was: no evidence of illegal conduct other than a single incident reported months ago

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers put the matter in this way: the MSC would say the result of the review was the material that they had disclosed to us, but we havent received or -- I understand there is no formal report as a result of their review

CLAIM sentence:  Neither has the Inquiry heard any evidence in relation to the findings of the reviews conducted by the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of the quantity of evidence that has emerged from these titles and the evidence of DAC Akers, no further information has been sought

CLAIM sentence:  In the meantime, the MSC has also begun to implement governance reforms in the newspaper titles at NI

CLAIM sentence:  These reforms include improving policies relating to anti-bribery, whistleblowing and payments

CLAIM sentence:  These changes have been implemented through the office of Gerson Zweifach and appropriate information relating to them has been disseminated to employees and staff at NI

TOPIC 2 KEY WORDS: http www levesoninquiry pdf lines
Number of CLAIMS related to this TOPIC: 867

CLAIM sentence:  What this countryand the Househas to confront is an episode that is, frankly, disgraceful: accusations of widespread lawbreaking by parts of our press: alleged corruption by some police officers; and, as we have just discussed, the failure of our political system over many, many years to tackle a problem that has been getting worse

CLAIM sentence:  Relatives of those who died at the hands of terrorism, war heroes and murder victimspeople who have already suffered in a way that we can barely imaginehave been made to suffer all over again

CLAIM sentence:  Let me now turn to the action that the Government are taking

CLAIM sentence:  Clearly there are two pieces of work that have to be done

CLAIM sentence:  So,  HC Hansard,  July , vol , col -  A\xcafter listening carefully, we have decided that the best way to proceed is with one inquiry, but in two parts

CLAIM sentence: levesoninquiry

CLAIM sentence: uk/people/assessors/sir-paul-scott-lee/  HC Hansard,  July , vol , col ; see also columns , ,   PART A | The InquiryA\xc

CLAIM sentence:  In a ruling of  October , I rejected the view that the Assessors were a hybrid between assessors within the meaning of s of the Inquiries Act  and members of the determining panel (as set out in s)

CLAIM sentence:  They have kept at the front of my mind the ways in which those titles appeal to their very large readership and the vital importance of ensuring that it is taken into account in full measure which I have done

CLAIM sentence:  The role of the Assessors was described by me in my ruling of  October , when I said: 

CLAIM sentence:  Albeit based on an inquisitorial model (with Counsel to the Inquiry conducting the forensic investigation), a judicial inquiry will thereafter proceed rather as any judicial investigation or trial might

CLAIM sentence:  Witnesses to the incident will be called and the Inquiry panel will then exercise the usual functions of a judge sitting alone and find the facts, that is to say, on the balance of probabilities, reach conclusions as to what actually happened

CLAIM sentence:  This exercise will usually involve deciding precisely what, as a matter of fact, caused or led to the event, who was responsible for making what decisions and what impact those decisions have had

CLAIM sentence:  Although the facts will be found as to what has happened and why, an Inquiry will go on to recommend steps that might be taken in the future to avoid similar problems

CLAIM sentence:  There is and will be no determination of civil or criminal liability

CLAIM sentence:  This is the reason for the Inquiry being split into two parts (with the question who did what to whom generally falling within Part , which is intended to follow the conclusion of any criminal prosecutions)

CLAIM sentence:  Chapter  | The Approach This has two consequences, the implications of which are important

CLAIM sentence:  This encompasses allegations that the two have become far too close, involving the payment of money or the provision of other favours for inside information, prior notice of newsworthy incidents or participation in high profile operations (including presence at arrests)

CLAIM sentence:  A subsidiary concern has been that whatever view I might have about these fundamental freedoms, I would change them in the light of what they perceive to be unbalanced evidence of problems

CLAIM sentence:  As I will repeat at various stages throughout this Report, I am very conscious that most journalism, most of the time meets high standards and can compete with the best journalism in the world; the Inquiry has been concerned with that which does not

CLAIM sentence:  These briefings are not formal parts of the record of the Inquiry; I am, however, satisfied that they accurately reflected the current position and, where those who provided them gave evidence, they were happy to incorporate into the record what they said at the briefings

CLAIM sentence:  This was taken forward by three seminars held over two full days

CLAIM sentence:  Again, these seminars are not formal parts of the record but, again, in the case of all those who gave presentations or otherwise contributed and who later attended to give evidence, each attested to the accuracy of what he or she then said and accepted that their contribution should be taken as part of their evidence

CLAIM sentence:  In each case, after a formal presentation, there was an open debate before an invited audience

CLAIM sentence:  It is not necessary to summarise the views expressed either in the presentations or by the others who contributed to the seminars

CLAIM sentence:  To such extent as they have been incorporated into the record of the Inquiry (which, during the course of subsequent evidence, most have), they will be reflected in the analysis that follows

CLAIM sentence:  In a criminal trial or family proceedings, civilian witnesses are victims, involved in personal tragedy or accidental (and, in many cases, reluctant) participants in the process of justice; they can be cross examined at length and, frequently, as to their credit

CLAIM sentence:  Running at the same time as the briefings and seminars, as a fifth preliminary step, it was necessary to determine who should be entitled to Core Participant status for any or all of the modules of the Inquiry and to decide how the Inquiry should proceed in the light of any representations that Core Participants might make

CLAIM sentence:  Throughout the Inquiry, there are references to what I have described as the mantra that I have not presently been concerned with who did what to whom but culture practices and ethics

CLAIM sentence:  pdf  There are numerous references in the transcripts to this approach; see, for example, the ruling in relation to Rule  of the Inquiry Rules  [para ], http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This latter process has given rise to misunderstanding which I have frequently sought to correct during the course of the Inquiry but which it is appropriate to make very clear

CLAIM sentence:  While the evidence on Module  was proceeding, a number of submissions were received from campaigning groups who argued that the approach of the PCC to third party complaints was such that there was no avenue for redress in the absence of a identified victim who was prepared to pursue a complaint on his or her own behalf

CLAIM sentence:  This was not simply a complaint about tone or balance (although there were such concerns as well) because it was well understood that newspapers, unlike broadcasters, were perfectly entitled to be partisan in their views

CLAIM sentence:  conceptual issues (such as climate change or science generally) were similarly not covered by the complaints system

CLAIM sentence:  To that end a number of police officers gave evidence, along with the relevant Directors of Public Prosecutions and leading counsel instructed in the prosecution of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach Draft Criteria for a Regulatory Solution 

CLAIM sentence:  The system should be a good fit with other relevant regulatory and law enforcement functions

CLAIM sentence:  The solution must be sufficiently reliably financed to allow for reasonable operational independence and appropriate scope, but without placing a disproportionate burden on either the industry, complainants or the taxpayer

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach changes if any would be desirable in this respect, in order to maximise the overall public interest? If relevant, please state whether those changes should be voluntary or obligatory

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, the part that is or can be taken by Core Participants (or anyone else) is defined by statute and does not fall within the general discretion of the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  () Where (a) witness other than a core participant has been questioned orally in the course of an inquiry hearing by counsel to the inquiry, or by the inquiry panel; and (b) that witnesss evidence directly relates to the evidence of another witness, the recognised legal representative of the witness to whom the evidence relates may apply to the chairman for permission to question the witness who has given oral evidence

CLAIM sentence:  That was, in fact, the way in which the Inquiry proceeded but it did so in an even-handed way

CLAIM sentence:  Many have argued that this the Inquiry should have proceeded in this way on the basis that all were or may have been affected or influenced by the way in

CLAIM sentence:  levesoninquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Where it was possible to do so, every communication (a number of which were anonymous) was acknowledged and considered so that a decision could be taken as to whether it was right to take what was said forward in any way

CLAIM sentence:  This lack of clarity is itself unhelpful and potentially productive either of very substantial delay or satellite litigation (in each case with attendant cost) or both

CLAIM sentence:  It is equally consistent with the principle that my intention not to prejudice criminal proceedings means that I have not identified those alleged to have been involved in mobile phone interception; therefore, in fairness, although there are exceptions when I have considered that the narrative compels specificity, generally speaking, I have exercised similar restraint in respect of those, not being investigated, who may be responsible for similar or other illegal or unethical practices

CLAIM sentence:  This ruling fell within to s() (b) of the Inquiries Act  and had any Core Participant wished to challenge it by way of judicial review, that course was open within  days

CLAIM sentence:  There was no such challenge and, insofar as generic criticism is concerned, I have followed it

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to Module Two and the police, different considerations apply on the basis that there being no ongoing criminal investigation into the conduct of the MPS (although there are  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | Further Issues of Law inquiries into other aspects of police conduct in relation to the press)

CLAIM sentence:  Throughout the hearing of Module Three, I emphasised that politicians were entitled to be friendly with whosoever they wished; absent some impact on the public interest, it is no part of the work of the Inquiry to challenge that right

CLAIM sentence:  Flowing from that, however, are two further consequences

CLAIM sentence:  As in every other walk of life, regulation is required for the small minority

CLAIM sentence:  In Part , there is a requirement to consider the implications of what is then found to have happened

CLAIM sentence:  In other words, Part  of this Inquiry is a qualitative exercise of sufficient breadth to determine the appropriate recommendations to make for the future

CLAIM sentence:  Part  requires a far greater and more detailed factual investigation than has Part : this is not surprising given that the Terms of Reference were split into two because of the ongoing police investigation and the lack of clarity as to where it might lead)

CLAIM sentence:  Against that background it is necessary to consider the overriding obligation as to the procedure or conduct of the Inquiry, which requires me to act with fairness and with regard to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost

CLAIM sentence:  Further, although the Inquiry may not rule on and has no power to determine, any persons civil or criminal liability, it is not inhibited in the discharge of its function by any likelihood of liability being inferred from the facts that it determines or recommendations that it makes

CLAIM sentence:  I have no intention of either applauding one paper for its culture, practices and ethics or (with the exception of the NoTW) of condemning another

CLAIM sentence:  The point is made in this way

CLAIM sentence:  To a point, the argument is well made and correct

CLAIM sentence:  Each generality along with each example is intended to provide or add to the narrative of facts against which to judge the regulatory regime and consider what should now take its place

CLAIM sentence: pdf at para   PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | Further Issues of Law  (to the effect that the report could contain anything else the panel considers relevant to the terms of reference), concluded that it was open to him to express suspicion that an allegation is true

CLAIM sentence:  I recognise, however, the need for real caution before proceeding along these lines

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Paras  and  et seq, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  I have not been made aware of any technical reason why my recommendations should not be able to be accommodated, with appropriate adjustment, in all parts of the UK, but I have not sought detailed advice on the matter

CLAIM sentence:  I intend no discourtesy at all by this approach and hope that those with the relevant decision-making responsibilities will understand the reasons

CLAIM sentence:  It is argued that the Terms of Reference are either too broad or too narrow

CLAIM sentence:  This Report, therefore, is the work of many hands, all working to my direction and reflecting my views; that is the inevitable consequence of the way in which the work has had to be done

CLAIM sentence:  They are concepts which are capable of being, and have been, used both rhetorically and analytically to explain and support a range of different perspectives, arguments and conclusions

CLAIM sentence:  The applicants argue that in their cases the criminal justice system has failed, and that they have been wrongly convicted

CLAIM sentence:  It is one I emphasised myself on several occasions

CLAIM sentence:  A number of serving editors have given the Inquiry the benefit of a perspective from the front line

CLAIM sentence:  The argument from democracy is, so to speak, a guiding light

CLAIM sentence:  That it needs to be stated at all, and more than stated, emphasised, is a result of two lines of argument put to the Inquiry, both of which are dealt with more fully below

CLAIM sentence:  It will often be a matter of balancing a number of outcomes which would be for the common good, but which cannot all be achieved simultaneously

CLAIM sentence:  There are critical decisions to be taken about how to balance, weigh and reconcile many things that are in themselves good but not all of which may be simultaneously achievable

CLAIM sentence:  So it is a complex task for those charged with it, and one for which accountabilities are rightly demanded

CLAIM sentence:  These may sometimes need to be reconciled

CLAIM sentence:  When one individuals right to freedom of expression is inconsistent with the similar rights of another, a difficult balancing exercise must be carried out in law

CLAIM sentence:  There are, for example, those cases in which the free speech of one party is experienced in a very intimate way as a threat to the core self-expression and identity of another

CLAIM sentence: pdf  See, for example, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act ; European Union Framework Decision //JHA on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law

CLAIM sentence:  Violation of the private sphere must always be proportionate to any larger public interest being served

CLAIM sentence:  The element of control over ones personal life is never all-or-nothing, but a matter of an infinite number of degrees and decisions

CLAIM sentence: pdf  To use two of the examples of potentially supervening public interest considerations presently identified in the Editors Code of Practice  p, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  How far this goes is another question

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, when confronted with conflicting claims under two protected ECHR rights, the courts must undertake a difficult balancing exercise to determine which will prevail

CLAIM sentence:  This is the reason why there is no protection for speech (written or oral) which unjustifiably damages a persons reputation or which interferes with a persons reasonable expectation of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  The fallacy of this line of reasoning was emphasised to the Inquiry in a number of ways: The key point here is that the fact that people have a (vicious) curiosity clearly does not entail a right to know those things, nor does it automatically excuse those who breach other norms in the service of that curiosity

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly the organisation needs to have its ethical code, but that code needs to be fully understood and endorsed by its owners and editors, and these people need to live  pp-, lines -, Professor Baroness ONeill, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This is a decisive factor in that code having meaning for all who work in the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  But their living it out means thinking about how they can convey the code through their practice right across the organisation, how they interact with employees right across the organisation in a way that makes it resonant for them

CLAIM sentence:  Secondly, an ethical organisation needs to have an open and honest culture in which it is possible for members of the organisation to raise their concerns about practices and to discuss them with colleagues and senior staff

CLAIM sentence:  [S]taff need to feel confident that if they perceive unsatisfactory practices to be developing, or face a challenging situation, they can raise the matter with colleagues or senior staff

CLAIM sentence:  And they need to be confident that they can do so, and have a proper discussion, without fear of mockery or retribution

CLAIM sentence:  So these things happen as a result of different, frequently unrelated episodes

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Brooke perceived a causal link between the credible threat by policy makers of the introduction of statutory regulation for the press, and the introduction by the industry of limited measures to improve the existing system of self-regulation for the press, a system that has worked overall to the distinct advantage of the industry: The other Royal Commissions and Lord Youngers Commission werent quite so fruitful, but then there wasnt a Private Member around to help

CLAIM sentence:  The same reasoning has been pursued more forthrightly in submissions to the Inquiry by Professor Brian Cathcart of Kingston University

CLAIM sentence:  Ideally, such a system of self regulation should be universal but he did not expand on his thinking as to how bodies outside that system might be induced to join

CLAIM sentence:  A similar line of argument was advanced by Baroness Buscombe, who told the Inquiry that the speed and flexibility of the current system are advantageous when compared with attempts to find resolution through the courts

CLAIM sentence:  She suggested that had the system of self-regulation been closer to a formal regulatory process, with potentially a system of fines for breaches, the efficacy of the PCC in dealing with complaints and pre-publication issues would have been compromised

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Stephen Abell said that the PCC anti-harassment service was one of the cornerstones of the fast moving part of the system of self-regulation for the press; something, that by implication may not be possible or practicable under a different system

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has made clear that the initial telephone conversation with the affected party or, in some cases, their representatives is usually handled by a senior member of Commission staff

CLAIM sentence:  If these measures fail and you feel that you are still being harassed, contact the PCC immediately

CLAIM sentence:  I will now look how complaints are dealt with by the PCC, considering in turn the different aspects of that system: who might make a complaint; the circumstances in which an individual might complain; the limitations on the ability of a complainant to make a complaint; the informal resolution of complaints; and complaints deemed inadmissible

CLAIM sentence:  The majority of complaints to other regulators, however, are rejected because the complainant has not followed due process and has used the regulator in question, rather than the regulated company, as the starting point for the complaint

CLAIM sentence:  In such cases, the complaint is referred back to the company in question

CLAIM sentence:  Only two publications had more than one upheld adjudication against them

CLAIM sentence:  It is without doubt that the handling of complaints was the main and dominant part of the PCCs business, taking up most of the day to day function of the Secretariat

CLAIM sentence:  After salaries, administration and property costs, complaints handling accounted for the greatest part of the remaining budget

CLAIM sentence:  To this extent, therefore, this initial advice did have a causative bearing on the subsequent course of the police investigation and it will be necessary to consider any continued impact it might have had as time passed

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of Ms Dowds advice, however, the police cannot be criticised for adopting the investigative approach described by DCS Williams

CLAIM sentence:  Option two was to hand over the investigation to another police unit; option three was to commence a formal investigation to prosecute those intercepting the Royal Household voicemail messages and in tandem with the above establish whether or not there are evidential links to the potentially wider unauthorised intrusion/access suspected by O

CLAIM sentence:  In line with the preliminary advice from the CPS, he then set about deciding how best to prove the interception of voicemail messages before they had been heard by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence: Initially it was because by that stage my officers were very familiar with the quite complicated technical aspects of this offenceThey had also engendered the confidence of the royal household in the way in which they were conducting themselves and the investigation, and because of the wider nature of what was happening, it would have meant picking apart the investigation and perhaps hiving off one part to one department, keeping another part with us, and that would have not made any sort of operational sense

CLAIM sentence:  Having been asked whether it was possible that there were speculative discussions along the lines that there might be circumstantial or inferential evidence, as opposed to anything concrete, he said: Its certainly possible, although I have no recollection of it, and I think from my point of view I would have been looking to see whether there was a possibility of a case, rather than whether there was something that was speculative

CLAIM sentence:  Similar concerns (examined in the next section) deal with the strategy adopted to deal with the aftermath of the investigation, particularly in relation to victims or potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, it has been necessary to investigate in detail the circumstances in which the police reached the decision not to take Operation Caryatid further

CLAIM sentence:  This involves an understanding of the police operational background at the time of the investigation, and an analysis of the evidential issues concerning the police along the possible next steps that could have been taken

CLAIM sentence:  Both of these cases led to multi-defendant prosecutions which in all took over three years to come to a conclusion, and devoured huge amounts of investigative resource throughout that time

CLAIM sentence:  The subsequent criminal investigation was the largest ever carried out in the UK, drawing in detective resources from across the country, and in effect lasted right through until the Inquest into the deaths of the victims of the / attacks was concluded in

CLAIM sentence:  The lines of investigation could have been pursued, and, as a detective, I would like to have pursued them

CLAIM sentence:  Neither is this failure simply bureaucratic: in my judgment, it was significant because the absence of any written explanation of the rationale behind the decision but also the evidential stage that the investigation had reached along with details of the outstanding leads may well have had important consequences in , when the then Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, was tasked with establishing the facts around Operation Caryatid

CLAIM sentence:  He said: what do you then do with those matters that could be part of a criminal investigation, but for very proper resourcing decisions you decide not to take that option, which is not unusual in many investigations, and I think that there are two relevant factors there: one, you have to ensure that if you are taking those matters elsewhere, from a crime prevention perspective or to change behaviour or to deal with victims in a better way, then you have to make sure you land those issues with those other agencies or government

CLAIM sentence: pdf  p, lines -, ibid  pp-, lines -, ibid  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcWhat matters insofar as the Terms of Reference are concerned is whether the detectives honestly held the views that they did (rather than whether their views were necessarily well- founded) and were not influenced by any relationships between senior officers within the MPS and NI

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams went further because, when asked whether there was any sense that he was taking on a large and powerful organisation and that there were dangers in doing so, he said: I think with any large organisation, yes, we were aware of it in terms of a big organisation, which is why we carried out such a thorough investigation, why we sought so much advice from the CPS, in particular in terms of when it came to our arrest phase, because we wanted to be able to seize as much evidence as possible and do it in a proper and professional manner so that we could not be criticised for the way we carried out our investigation

CLAIM sentence:  I accept the evidence that, if anything, the fact that he was investigating a large organisation made it all the more important that DCS Williams did a good job, both in terms of the way the investigation was conducted and in ensuring that the evidence was sound

CLAIM sentence:  Reading between the lines, it was likely to have been within his contemplation that if there were any flaws in the investigation process or the evidence, they would be exploited to the fullest extent possible by the organisations legal team

CLAIM sentence:  First, quite apart from whether DCS Williams was aware of any close social relationships, if such there were, there is no evidence that any decision that he made as to the investigation was not entirely justifiable on logical and reasonable grounds; from the outset, he pursued it vigorously and effectively

CLAIM sentence:  His response was:  p, lines -, ibid

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams did not apply the narrow interpretation of s of RIPA when identifying victims

CLAIM sentence:  There could well be a wider pool of people that have been compromised as a result of his activity or indeed anywhere else

CLAIM sentence:  So this strategy was aimed at the full potential of what those potential victims might be

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence indicates that the police did not notify all the victims for whom they were responsible and neither does it appear that the plan was ever, in terms, communicated to the phone companies, despite a large part of the responsibility for informing victims being intended to fall on them

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcserved to reinforce my belief

CLAIM sentence:  The issue of the obligation to inform customers/victims to my knowledge was never explicitly documented anywhere either by the police or indeed the telephone companies

CLAIM sentence:  O were adamant that they would only inform us of possible victims after they had informed their customers and sought consent

CLAIM sentence:  To further reinforce this I ensured that the phone companies, especially those not as close to the investigation as the two mentioned herein, were briefed, and, through Jack Wraith, that any victims were directed back to this investigation

CLAIM sentence:  I can well understand the reason for the concern that these witnesses had about the approach of the police which underlines the failure adequately to enunciate and implement a sensible and appropriate policy of notifying those who needed to know that their communications may not have been secure and their privacy had been violated or, at the very least, at risk

CLAIM sentence:  In part that was achieved by mounting the high profile prosecution of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcsupporting that conclusion

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees accepted that it would have been possible to go to NI and have a conversation although: it may well have been viewed cynically

CLAIM sentence:  Im sure they were well aware of what it was that we suspected, and given that ultimately a member of their senior management team resigned on the basis of what wed found, I would have expected any senior management in an organisation to question why had that happened and to understand exactly what had gone on

CLAIM sentence:  I dont necessarily expect someone to come and tell me that I should do that, and actually, I may be wrong, but Im not aware in either Ive not done it and Im not aware of my fellow investigators having actually gone and this in senior companies

CLAIM sentence:  I know in frauds, then, but thats more in terms of vulnerabilities of a system as opposed to actually something being wrong in the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams was right to expect the senior management at NI to conduct an internal investigation and take such preventative measures as were necessary, but it was not safe to assume that they would do so

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS submits that it was made abundantly clear to NI that  pp-, lines -, Keith Surtees, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  pp-, lines -, ibid  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcthe police suspected that voicemail interception was more widespread and that the message was delivered very firmly that they had a problem with employees engaged in sustained periods of criminal activity

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, this argument misses the point: what was important was not what the NoTW knew or appreciated but that the police had strong grounds for believing that the offending was more extensive than the public line being deployed and that the fact that the investigation had not gone further should not be taken as police endorsement of an attempt to minimise what had been uncovered

CLAIM sentence:  Even if the narrow interpretation of RIPA were correct, however, and therefore that the police had only positively proved voicemail interception in a small number of cases, the statement was nonetheless misleading because it suggested that the police had been able to rule out voicemail interception beyond that small number of victims

CLAIM sentence: pdf  That would suggest that Counsel were not relying on the narrower view of the law: as discussed above, a criminal charge would not be pursued if counsel for the Crown did not consider it sustainable as a matter of law  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcthat the interception took place before the relevant voicemail message had been heard by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  He said: I dont accept thats the case either

CLAIM sentence:  There may Keith Surtees may have had suspicions and those suspicions are clearly well-founded now, but they werent there was no evidence then

CLAIM sentence:  If there had been any evidence for us to pursue Youre judging me on  by what was taking place in July  

CLAIM sentence:  I did not find this distinction to be convincing: in my experience, police officers have a well developed understanding of what constitutes evidence and the more likely challenge arises when police officers seek to push the boundary of what is provable as evidence beyond that which a criminal lawyer will accept

CLAIM sentence:  He maintained that it was only with the benefit of hindsight that his decision not to re-open the investigation was wrong: I have also stated publicly that the decision not to reopen the investigation was a poor one in the light of what we now know I had no way of knowing at that time the extent of the NoTWs deliberate cover-up of the wider involvement of others in this activity

CLAIM sentence:  Any of these would have alerted DCS Williams to the fact that Lord Prescott had, indeed, been suspected of having been either a potential victim or a possible target

CLAIM sentence:  Once it is appreciated that his staff have been targeted, it is not difficult to conclude that they were being used as a means of learning about his private communications

CLAIM sentence:  That would not have been a proportionate step to take when the failure to notify Lord Prescott was so abundantly clear and the cause of that failure could be narrowed to some form of mistake or misjudgement rather than any improper influence connected to NI

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, for example, the for Neville email was part of the unused material and so was not examined

CLAIM sentence:  What we were worried about was is there any evidence around this, and the view I was given was: no, there wasnt

CLAIM sentence:  The latter apparently had a poor track record in terms of conviction, because of the complexity of what had to be proved and the latter had not been used in respect of telephone voicemail 

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of the way that DCS Surtees now puts the matter, it is surprising that DCS Surtees did not himself later correct this misunderstanding: by then, of course, the decision had been made and the defensive line published

CLAIM sentence:  above) that the for Neville email did not form part of the documentation sent by the MPS to the CPS in , but it is clear from the transcript of the hearing before Gross J on  January  that the CPS and Counsel were aware of the existence of the contract  p, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Not published  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcthe DPP which set out in summary form the CPS involvement in the case in 

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps the most important part of it for present purposes was paragraph , which read: In addition to Goodman and Mulcaire a third man 

CLAIM sentence:  was arrested but was not charged due to there being insufficient evidence to proceed against him

CLAIM sentence:  NO other suspects were considered or charged

CLAIM sentence:  This has been confirmed to Asker Hussain by DCI Surtees: no other named suspects 

CLAIM sentence:  were confirmed as suspects of criminal activity through this investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Prosecution counsel has also confirmed that there were no other suspects apart from these three individuals

CLAIM sentence:  In light of my findings, it would not be appropriate to re-open the cases against Goodman or Mulcaire, or to revisit the decisions taken in the course of investigating and prosecuting them

CLAIM sentence:  Against this backdrop I knew how challenging it had been to get the case this far based upon technical proof (this is a huge challenge which perhaps understandably everyone is underestimating) and now that potential other persons who may or may not have been involved were alerted my belief was that we would not be able to secure the level of proof necessary to get across the criminal threshold

CLAIM sentence:  Added to the above I knew that any attempt by us would [be] highly likely to be protracted for the reasons already highlighted and it would risk clouding the issues around a solid, clear and proportionate case

CLAIM sentence:  All of the above was not a decision that I made in isolation

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Not published  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcmight have been required to even begin exploring that

CLAIM sentence:  There was no appetite to expand the investigation and the strategic guidance given to me was to continue with what I had before me as outlined above

CLAIM sentence:  Victim Cooperation I believe the current climate is making an assumption around who would want to come forward as a victim/witness

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment, this is another example of the way in which DCS Williams represented matters defensively and in such a way as to reinforce the decision that reopening the investigation was unwarranted

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcStarmer did not suggest that there was anything sinister or untoward about this, given the time of day

CLAIM sentence:  Under the rubric Challenges, DCS Williams set out his understanding of the law which continued to be based on the narrow view of RIPA 

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, he set out his analysis that there was nothing to indicate that Neville had actually seen the document and that even if he had, reading the email would not have been an offence and so there was no evidence to link him to a conspiracy to intercept communications

CLAIM sentence:  above, the advice Mr Perry gave in  was that although the narrow view was arguably correct, the argument could be met in a number of ways and in any event the inchoate offence of conspiracy did not depend for its proof on the correctness of the narrow interpretation  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcbackground; secondly, reviewing his papers relating to the prosecution; and, thirdly, if it was necessary, reconsidering the likely interpretation of s of RIPA

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams (whom I have also criticised) said: In my workings with [Mr Yates], Ive not worked with him directly before, but I saw nothing or heard nothing that me think that we that there was anything wrong going on here, that we were looking to hide anything

CLAIM sentence:  He was looking at an investigation that was four years old

CLAIM sentence:  If this was the approach, it is difficult to explain how it developed

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees does also make the point that the meetings record only a small part of the discussions that took place

CLAIM sentence:  PW reviewed all files again and decided original victim strategy still stood re informing people (i

CLAIM sentence:  nothing had changed, apart from Coulson position) and after speaking with JY, it was decided no further contact was attempted with any other people

CLAIM sentence:  O said: The matter was fully investigated, and information came to light indicating a small number of additional O customers who may have been targeted in the same way

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Not published  Not published  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcsubsequently asked DCS Williams or DCS Surtees what had been ascertained from the phone companies

CLAIM sentence:  ALTIA was a relatively new IT system, which had not been available when the investigation began, which enabled the mass scanning of hard copy exhibits to make them searchable on the HOLMES database

CLAIM sentence:  You have that email in your pack, where Ive said as a matter of priority I took people off counter terrorism operations to put all the material on the HOLMES system

CLAIM sentence:  Now, if during that exercise run by detectives who, you know, would have a detective outlook, I would have expected, if concerns began to be raised about whats actually in that material, stuff thats come out, that I would have been told, but that didnt happen

CLAIM sentence:  So I was sufficiently exercised, as critical incident in the Met parlance, to put the stuff on a computer, to invest I think it was ten detectives for three or four months working long days to put all this material on a system so I could search it, so I could actually with confidence say when people wrote in, I could say youre either on the system or not on the system

CLAIM sentence:  Now unfortunately that exercise wasnt done as thoroughly as it should have been

CLAIM sentence:  There does not appear to have been any real reaction to the implications of this email correspondence or beginnings of a recognition that the victim notification strategy had failed

CLAIM sentence:  The only customers from this list we did not contact as part of that process were the members of the royal household that the police were dealing with directly

CLAIM sentence:  A similar process would then have had to be undertaken to link phone numbers and or voicemail messages to these individuals

CLAIM sentence:  A view might be that some of the people are well known and it would have been easy to make contact

CLAIM sentence:  Equally the more lengths we go to [to] contact individuals, potentially through other people, we risk breaching their anonymity around this case, again for no great gain

CLAIM sentence:  Where is the balance of reasonableness? For some of the  we are not sure who they are/their relevance in terms of known individuals

CLAIM sentence:  There were to be no further charges and one of the purposes of informing potential victims was to enable  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcthem to take steps, if so advised, to seek whatever redress they saw fit: the enforcement of privacy rights in the civil courts, therefore, did not appear to register with the police as a worthwhile outcome

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, the lack of appetite for ensuring that all potential victims were informed was a misjudgement

CLAIM sentence:  It is noteworthy that, even in this letter, DCS Williams was not verifying whether the original victim notification strategy had been implemented because that would have required him to ask whether the phone companies had completed the two stages: that is to say, they had both identified all customers whose voicemail boxes had been dialled by the suspect numbers and then notified those customers

CLAIM sentence:  This was part of the police investigation and for the MPS to identify

CLAIM sentence:  These failings on the part of the police are difficult to explain

CLAIM sentence:  The most likely explanation in my judgment is that the officers concerned did not look beyond the assumption that it had worked, at least substantially

CLAIM sentence:  Once more, however, there is no evidential basis for inferring that the police approach was influenced in any way by relationships with NI

CLAIM sentence:  Although this will be discussed later in this Report, as part of this narrative, it is worth including the response of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  the following statement was issued:  R (Bryant, Montague, Paddick and Prescott) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [] EWHC  (Admin)  p, lines -, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  This is probably because DCS Williams did not consider that the possible targeting of Lord Prescotts staff constituted sufficient indication that he was a potential victim although it is difficult to understand why he would reach that conclusion because the link to Lord Prescotts staff had been made: para

CLAIM sentence:  We opened up the files as much as we could

CLAIM sentence:  They did risk accounts and they have got four lever-arch files of payment records, everything to do with Mulcaire, and there is no evidence of anything going beyond in terms of knowledge into other activities

CLAIM sentence:  The determination of NI to maintain a line that the editor and the legal director believed was not true in the face of two investigations by the CMS Committee and two investigations by the PCC is extraordinary and, at the very least, a demonstration of loyalty to the NoTW and its reputation which says a great deal about the culture of the paper (to say nothing of its practices and its approach to ethical propriety)

CLAIM sentence:  I considered whether there was anything new in the Guardian articles in terms of additional evidence, and I considered finally our approach to the victims, how they were managed and dealt with and the impact of further inquiries, if they had been necessary, on them, and I came to the view, and I appreciate you all thought it was rather quick, that there was no new evidence in this case

CLAIM sentence:  It was a conflation of three old stories

CLAIM sentence:  A key conclusion of the Committee was that the police had been wrong not to investigate further the contract or the for Neville email and that the reasons given on behalf of the MPS were not adequate: In  the Metropolitan Police made a considered choice, based on available resources, not to investigate either the holding contract between Greg Miskiw and Glenn Mulcaire, or the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  The email was a strong indication both of additional lawbreaking and of the possible involvement of others

CLAIM sentence:  By only notifying a small proportion of those whose phones may have been illegally accessed, the MPS had effectively shielded the NoTW from a large number of civil actions

CLAIM sentence:  There remains to this day no evidence that his phone was hacked by either Mulcaire or Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Heywood added that, in any event, even if the narrow interpretation should turn out to be correct, it would make no difference to investigators, because the inchoate offences of conspiracy or attempt would be unaffected by a narrow construction of the legislation

CLAIM sentence:  The police I am entirely satisfied that the officers who worked on Operation Caryatid approached their task with complete integrity and that each of the decisions taken during the investigation and prosecution was appropriate, justified and in keeping with the operational imperatives of the police at that time

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment, there is simply no scope for concluding that the decision was in any way influenced by pressure from, fear of, or any personal relationships with, employees of NI or the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  That is, however, only the start of the matter

CLAIM sentence:  It is entirely understandable that, as more and more has emerged, concern has been increasingly expressed that the MPS was protecting the NoTW for it was the reputation of that paper that benefited from the targeted focus of the investigation and the fact that only a small number of potential victims were notified of the facts

CLAIM sentence:  In the same way that I have no doubt that the decision to limit the scope of the investigation was not linked to any relationship with NI, I am similarly sure that the failure either to devise or to execute an appropriate strategy was not influenced in any way by, or connected to, any inappropriate relationship between the MPS and NI

CLAIM sentence:  In truth, in the light of the stance taken by the NoTW over a period of years, it is likely that nothing would have been done and police concern would have been dismissed

CLAIM sentence:  At this distance of time and with so much more now known, it is difficult to know what could or should have been done

CLAIM sentence:  As it was, the issue was not even considered

CLAIM sentence:  The episode was viewed as an aberration,  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcinvolving one journalist and it was maintained that a full, rigorous internal inquiry was being carried out

CLAIM sentence:  The determination of NI to maintain a line that, at the very least, the legal director believed was not true (and in which, at the very least, the editor, Mr Myler could not be said to have had confidence) in the face of two investigations by the CMS Committee and two investigations by the PCC is extraordinary and, at the very least, a demonstration of loyalty to the NoTW and its reputation which says a great deal about the culture of the paper (to say nothing of its practices and its approach to ethical propriety)

CLAIM sentence:  Between July  and January , the failure to reopen Operation Caryatid (or at the very least to conduct a proper scoping exercise to decide whether it should be reopened) can be reduced into five overlapping errors

CLAIM sentence:  There was a mischaracterisation of the evidence which had been provisionally reviewed in August/September  as amounting to no evidence either of other criminal offences or as implicating other potential defendants or, alternatively, if it was thought that there was evidence but only insufficient to prosecute, to consider whether, in the light of the Guardians article, that approach continued to be correct

CLAIM sentence:  He gave the impression, no doubt inadvertently but undeniably, that he was being deployed by NI to give support to the police line which, itself, was in support of NI

CLAIM sentence:  That doesnt mean to say you cant have completely cordial relations and high quality engagement with other professions or institutions, but at the same time I think the police are that organisation who can sometimes be called upon to investigate, and therefore the need for transparency, the need for accountability, is very high, quite properly, and I wasnt entirely convinced some of those risks were identified  pp-, lines -, Tim Godwin, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction On,  July , the Prime Minister made a statement to the House of Commons in these terms: In recent days, the whole country has been shocked by the revelations of the phone hacking scandal

CLAIM sentence:  Last night the Deputy Prime Minister and I met the Leader of the Opposition

CLAIM sentence:  Following these consultations, I want to set out today how we intend to proceed: first, on the public inquiry; secondly, on the issues surrounding News Internationals proposed takeover of BSkyB; and thirdly, on ethics in the police service and its relationship with the press

CLAIM sentence:  Before I do that, I will update the House on the current criminal investigation into phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  I met Sir Paul Stephenson last night

CLAIM sentence:  He assured me that the investigation is fully resourced

CLAIM sentence:  The commissioners office informed me this morning that the team has so far made eight arrests and undertaken numerous interviews

CLAIM sentence:  I can tell the House that the inquiry will be led by one of the most senior judges in the country, Lord Justice Leveson

CLAIM sentence:  Starting as soon as possible, Lord Justice Leveson, assisted by a panel of senior independent figures with relevant expertise in media, broadcasting, regulation and government will inquire into the culture, practices and ethics of the press; its relationship with the police; the failure of the current system of regulation; the contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians; why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded; and the issue of cross-media ownership

CLAIM sentence:  The second part of the inquiry will examine the extent of unlawful or improper conduct at the News of the World and other newspapers, and the way in which management failures may have allowed it to happen

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Justice Leveson has agreed to these draft terms of reference

CLAIM sentence:  No one should be in any doubt of our intention to get to the bottom of the truth and learn the lessons for the future

CLAIM sentence:  The Prime Minister returned to the topic on  July , when announcing the appointment of the Assessors

CLAIM sentence:  He said: We have made some significant amendments to the remit of the inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  To inquire into the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other newspaper organisations and, as appropriate, other organisations within the media, and by those responsible for holding personal data

CLAIM sentence:  To inquire into the way in which any relevant police force investigated allegations or evidence of unlawful conduct by persons within or connected with News International, the review by the Metropolitan Police of their initial investigation, and the conduct of the prosecuting authorities

CLAIM sentence:  To inquire into the extent to which the police received corrupt payments or other inducements, or were otherwise complicit in such misconduct or in suppressing its proper investigation, and how this was allowed to happen

CLAIM sentence:  To inquire into the extent of corporate governance and management failures at News International and other newspaper organisations, and the role, if any, of politicians, public servants and others in relation to any failure to investigate wrongdoing at News International 

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of these inquiries, to consider the implications for the relationships between newspaper organisations and the police, prosecuting authorities, and relevant regulatory bodies and to recommend what actions, if any, should be taken

CLAIM sentence:  By letter dated  July , as responsible Ministers under the Inquiries Act , the Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP (then the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sports) and Baroness Browning (then a Minister of State at the Home Office) appointed me to Chair the Inquiry pursuant to s()(a) of the Act

CLAIM sentence:  On the same date, their appointment having previously been announced by the Prime Minister, acting pursuant to s()(a) of the Act, the Ministers appointed six Assessors with a wide range of professional experience to assist the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  These were Sir David Bell, Shami Chakrabarti CBE, Lord (David) Currie, Elinor Goodman, George Jones and Sir Paul Scott-Lee

CLAIM sentence:  From the day of the announcement of my appointment, it was necessary to identify appropriate support

CLAIM sentence:  Kim Brudenell, a senior solicitor from the Treasury Solicitors office was appointed Solicitor to the Inquiry; Amanda Jeffery (from the Judicial Office) and Rachel Clark (from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and previously the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) were appointed as Heads of Administration and Research respectively

CLAIM sentence:  Having obtained cross party support for their appointment, when identifying them by name, the Prime Minister said of them these people have been chosen not only for their expertise in the media, broadcasting, regulation and policing, but for their complete independence from the interested parties

CLAIM sentence:  It was argued that this would make the Assessors into members of the panel pursuant to s of the Inquiries Act  and that they lacked balance on the basis that their number included nobody with tabloid or mid- market newspaper experience

CLAIM sentence:  I set out the role for assessors in para  of the Assessor Protocol in these terms: An assessor will take such part in the proceedings of the Inquiry as the Chairman may request, and in particular the Chairman may at any time request an assessor to: (a) Attend the whole or part of any hearing, seminar or briefing; and/or (b) Chair the whole or part of any seminar in an area of his or her expertise; and/ or (c) Prepare a report for the Chairman on any matter relevant to the Inquiry within the area of expertise of the assessor; and/or (d) Provide to Counsel to the Inquiry suggested lines of questioning for witnesses, in respect of any matters within his or her expertise; and/or (e) Provide the Chairman with any other assistance, or advice, on any matter relevant to the Inquiry within the expertise of the assessor

CLAIM sentence:  There is absolutely no point in my suggesting a way forward (if different from the present system) that everyone decries as unworkable; if that were my provisional view, I would want to be told

CLAIM sentence:  pdf  Chapter  | The AnnouncementA\xcengaging an assessor with experience of tabloid or mid-market newspapers (along with suggestions that nobody working in a broadsheet newspaper would be able to understand the dynamics of tabloid or mid-market journalism), nobody has suggested in evidence that the approach to ethical issues should be different

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, far from ignoring the different interests to which tabloid and mid-market newspapers appeal, the Assessors with experience of journalism have been assiduous to keep me aware, both in advance and as I was hearing the evidence, of the arguments that have in fact been put forward in favour of the needs of this profitable sector of the market

CLAIM sentence:  They will, however, not mind my saying here what I have assured them of many times as we have gone along: that my task in response has been to sift, weigh and test what they have said and make such use of it as seems to me right

CLAIM sentence:  It should be remembered that the Assessors were selected by the Prime Minister who, I repeat, described them as having been chosen for their complete independence from the interested parties

CLAIM sentence:  The Leader of the Opposition welcomed the Inquiry and indeed the panel members chosen by the Prime Minister

CLAIM sentence:  In an effort, at least in part, to assuage concern that I had no experience or perception of the issues faced by the newspaper industry and the way in which newspapers operate, I have been very willing to receive evidence on the topic

CLAIM sentence:  I was clear that one such newspaper should be regionally based and, prior to the commencement of the Inquiry, I visited the Southern Daily Echo in Southampton, the offices of Associated Newspapers Ltd (The Daily Mail and The Sunday Mail), Trinity Mirror plc (The Daily Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and The People) and News International Ltd (The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times)

CLAIM sentence:  The difference in the case of this Inquiry is the fact of the criminal investigations being undertaken by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS)

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, although the Director General of the BBC, then Mark Thompson, gave evidence, he did so only to provide a comparison between the approach adopted internally by the BBC Trust along with the oversight from Ofcom

CLAIM sentence:  In those circumstances, although there have been many calls during the Inquiry for me to expand the terms of reference to investigate other organisations (most recently the BBC in the wake of the allegations against Sir Jimmy Savile), it is simply outside the Terms of Reference within which I am working

CLAIM sentence:  Conversely, certain witnesses (and, in particular, Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, Rebekah Brooks and Andrew Coulson) were, or at least could be (subject to allowance in the cases of Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson to the fact that, at the time they gave evidence, they had been arrested as part of the police investigation and have now both been charged) central to a number of modules and I took the view that it was more sensible to deal with all aspects of the Inquiry towards the conclusion of the oral evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, the fourth module (the Future) was not intended, as might have been thought, to be free-standing

CLAIM sentence:  An approved summary of that briefing is, however, available and has been posted on the website

CLAIM sentence:  It was chaired by Sir David Bell, supported by Elinor Goodman and George Jones, and received presentations from Claire Enders of Enders Analysis on the competitive pressures facing the press today; Phil Hall (former editor of the NoTW, Hello! Magazine and director of the editorial department at Trinity Mirror plc) on how the press operates in a competitive environment and the pressures facing editors; and Richard Peppiatt (formerly a reporter on the Daily Star) on the day to day effect of competitive pressures on working journalists

CLAIM sentence:  The second day of seminars was held on Wednesday  October 

CLAIM sentence:  The morning was chaired by Lord Currie, supported by Shami Chakrabarti

CLAIM sentence:  The role of corporate governance was considered by Lord Borrie (formerly Director General of Fair Trading and thereafter Chair of the Advertising Standards Authority), Stephen Hill (formerly Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times and now a non-executive director of Channel Four television) and Sly Bailey (then Chief Executive of Trinity Mirror plc)

CLAIM sentence:  In the afternoon, chaired by Shami Chakrabarti supported by Lord Currie, redress for breach of standards was discussed by Professor Steven Barnett (Professor of Communications at the University of Westminster), Desmond Browne QC (a leading media silk and formerly Chairman of the Bar) and Professor Robert Baldwin (Professor of Law at the London School of Economics specialising in regulation)

CLAIM sentence:  Finally defending freedom of expression was the subject of presentations by John Kampfner (then Chief Executive of Index on Censorship), Professor James Curran (Professor of Communications at Goldsmiths, University of London and Chair of the Co-ordinating Committee for Media Reform) and Kelvin MacKenzie (a columnist for The Sun and the Daily Mail, formerly editor of The Sun and managing director of BskyB and Mirror Group Newspapers)

CLAIM sentence:  What is important to emphasise, however, is that, with very limited exception, all the speakers saw and took the opportunity of the seminars to analyse where recent events were leading and had led the business, industry or profession of journalism; in my view, this did a great deal to open up the issues to a wider audience

CLAIM sentence:  Without minimising any contribution from any speaker, I particularly mention Mr Dacre who, while challenging the justification upon which the Inquiry was set up (including the credentials of those participating in it), identifying what he described as paradoxes in the current furore over the press and seeking to de-bunk what he called myths surrounding the PCC, went on to recognise the need for reform if trust was to be regained and made a number of suggestions which openly and emphatically started the debate as to the future

CLAIM sentence:  This was a very important recognition of the need for change which, coming from an extremely important player in the  Mr Browne was later instructed to act on behalf of Trinity Mirror plc but I am entirely satisfied that his appearance at the Seminar was as an expert in the field and not as counsel to a media group that was later to become a Core Participant  A\xcindustry, was of enormous value

CLAIM sentence:  It is a matter of record that, as he was perfectly entitled to do, he later resiled from at least one of the suggestions that he then made

CLAIM sentence:  Broadcasting 

CLAIM sentence:  The fourth preliminary step in relation to the broad approach concerned the extent to which it would be appropriate to allow cameras into the Inquiry room to record the evidence and thereafter to stream it live onto the Inquiry website

CLAIM sentence:   At the third seminar, Mr Dacre said: While I abhor statutory controls, theres one area where Parliament can help the press

CLAIM sentence:  That is no longer his position: on  June , he submitted: In retrospect, after hearing some of the devastating evidence to the Inquiry in the third module, I regret this suggestion because I now fear that ANY parliamentary involvement would be the thin edge of the wedge which could result in fuller statutory control of the press: p, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, I am satisfied that the decision to stream the work of the Inquiry (and to enter into appropriate contractual relationships with television broadcasters as to the use to which it may be put) was entirely justified

CLAIM sentence:  Sky News and the BBC devoted a considerable proportion of time to televising the hearings and other media news channels used the footage both on television and as part of their online reporting

CLAIM sentence:  When dealing with the topic of televising the Inquiry, it is important to sound a note of caution

CLAIM sentence:  I am conscious that a number of people have used the valuable impact of the reporting of the Inquiry in support of the argument that all court proceedings should be capable of being televised and that the present restrictions contained within s of the Criminal Justice Act  should be removed

CLAIM sentence:  Applications by Ms Decoulous to appeal each decision refusing her Core Participant status were refused by the Administrative Court (Module  on  November  by Moses LJ and Singh J: [] EWHC (Admin); Module  on  March  by Richards LJ and Kenneth Parker J: CO//; and Modules  and  on  July  by Sir John Thomas PQBD and Silber J: CO//, CO//)  http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In his first statement to the Inquiry, the editor of The Times, James Harding, made a passing reference to a single instance of computer hacking

CLAIM sentence:  That led to a letter and a further statement from Mr Harding which resulted in his being recalled to give evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Because the Nightjack incident had been the subject of litigation, the then legal manager of The Times, Mr Alastair Brett, appeared at the Inquiry when the matter was analysed in some detail

CLAIM sentence:  On the basis of this evidence, it would certainly be possible to draw a number of important conclusions about what happened at The Times and about internal governance and legal risk management

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to witnesses whom the Inquiry approached, an invitation was posted on the website inviting members of the public and other interested individuals or groups to submit evidence directly to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry needs to understand how newsrooms operate, particularly in the tabloid and mid-market sectors

CLAIM sentence:  The Rt Hon Lord Justice Leveson as Chairman of the Leveson Inquiry [] EWHC  (Admin), http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/assoc-news-v-chair-leveson-inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  With the advent of the internet and  hour news as well as declines in revenue and circulation, we have heard that fewer journalists are having to do more work

CLAIM sentence:  It has been argued that the statutory regulation and impartiality requirements that apply to broadcasting do not chill investigative reporting on television

CLAIM sentence:  The inquiry would be interested in submissions on the extent to which the regulatory regime for broadcasting casts a chill on broadcast reporting and the relationship between the printed press and broadcast media as a result of the different regulatory environments

CLAIM sentence:  The briefings, seminars, and the collection, examination and distillation of the evidence meant that it was not possible to start the formal hearings of the Inquiry until Monday  November , when Robert Jay QC made an opening statement, followed by opening statements from the Core Participants

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, therefore, generic complaints (of misleading and inaccurate reporting of issues such as immigration, domestic violence and others) were unchallengeable

CLAIM sentence:  As explained by Fiona Fox (Science Media Centre) misleading and inaccurate reporting of  PART A | The InquiryA\xcChapter  | The Approach 

CLAIM sentence:  Quite apart from the question of the available time (given the very wide-ranging Terms of Reference and the other evidence that it was essential to capture), the question arose whether it was necessary to call this evidence orally in order to make the points that were developed in writing

CLAIM sentence:  In March , a private investigator, Daniel Morgan was murdered in South East London

CLAIM sentence:  There have been five police inquiries into the circumstances of his death and it has been alleged that his partner, Jonathan Rees, might have been involved in his murder (he was later acquitted when the prosecution were unable to guarantee his right to a fair trial following the discovery by the police of four undisclosed crates of material)

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Rees had been employed by the NoTW and, the nature of the relationship has been the subject of media comment

CLAIM sentence:  I can well understand why Mr Morgans family saw the Inquiry as an opportunity to uncover information about his death (and Mr Rees clearly visualised that possibility because he  Beat; Big Brother Watch; British Psychological Society; Carbon Brief; Carnegie Trust; Democratic Society; Disaster Action; Federation of Muslim Organisation; Federation of Poles in Great Britain; Full Fact; Howard League for Penal Reform; Inclusion London; Irish Traveller Movement; Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants; Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association (JENGbA); London Muslim Centre and the East London Mosque; Make Justice Work; Migrant and Refugee Communities Forum Mind and Rethink Mental Illness; National Aids Trust; Neuroimmune Alliance; Professionals Against Child Abuse; Refugee Council; Royal College of Psychiatrists; Runnymede Trust; Samaritans Sense About Science; Support After Murder and Manslaughter (National); Transparency International UK; UK Drug Policy Commission; United Communications Ltd; Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK and Association of Media Research (Joint Submission); Wish; Youth Media Agency  A\xcapplied for Core Participant status on the basis that he might be the subject of criticism)

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, although I made it clear that Mr Rees could make a statement for the Inquiry, he has not done so

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police officers, other police staff, and journalists as to how the current Police Service policies and guidance in place to regulate the relationship between the press and the police work in practice

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would therefore be interested to receive submissions on the type and frequency of contact which currently exists between police officers, other police staff, and the media (differentiating between local and national media contact), with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The internet,  hour news and social media has brought new challenges for both the police and the press

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police officers, other police staff, and journalists on how this may have altered the relationship, and whether the Police Service policies and guidance in place have kept pace with this changing environment, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views on the level of awareness and experience that exists within the Police Service of media crime (the unlawful interception of communications, bribery of officials by the media and harassment by paparazzi and journalists, for example), with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:   Other examples are discussed in the ruling concerning the evidence of Peter Tickner: see http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions on what Police Service training, governance and oversight arrangements exist, and views on whether it is sufficient, to ensure that acceptable boundaries exist between the police and press, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would welcome submissions on how the police and the media working together is and can be of benefit to the public, with examples where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would like to receive views as to whether it is felt that adequate governance and oversight arrangements are in place for police officers and other police staff to ensure the effective management and recording of gifts and hospitality, secondary business interests, associations and conflicts of interest

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether there should be rules in place to govern how and when police officers and other police staff leaving the Police Service can take up posts with the media, commercial or other bodies, with examples of when such a move has been problematic or brought advantages where possible

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether there should be rules in place to govern how and when members of the press, or the media more generally, can take up posts with the Police Service, with examples of when such a move has been problematic or brought advantages where possible

CLAIM sentence:  That was particularly so in relation to Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, the proprietors of other newspaper groups and a number of senior staff from News Corporation or News International

CLAIM sentence:  These included some of the most senior politicians of the last  years (including the present and last three Prime Ministers, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the First Minister of Scotland), senior civil servants, special advisers and political journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Political challenges came to the fore, however, in particular concerns about the handling by the present Government of the bid by News Corporation for those shares in BSkyB Ltd which were not already owned or controlled by Rupert Murdoch

CLAIM sentence:  Where does that knowledge come from? How is it tested? What use is made of publicly available information (for example about meetings between senior politicians and leading media figures)? Has the change to the Ministerial Code in July  made a difference? (The Code now states: the Government will be open about its links with the media

CLAIM sentence: pdf  One of the issues that arose in the House of Commons concerned the allegation that Mr Hunt had breached the terms of the Ministerial Code

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry is particularly interested in the influence of the media in the content and timing of a partys media policies, and in a Government decision-making on policy or operational issues directly affecting the media

CLAIM sentence:  Do you have any personal examples of how this works in practice? Are the media effective lobbyists in their own causes? Do any risks arise from the Governments role in the determination of takeovers and/ or mergers of media organisations? Is there a need for additional safeguards or limits on such involvement? 

CLAIM sentence:  Is there a need for plurality of voice in news providers within the press, in providers of other types of news media or across the media as a whole? How does access to news information through the internet affect the need for plurality? What level of plurality is required? Is plurality of ownership a sufficient proxy for plurality of voice? 

CLAIM sentence:  There are three aspects to the question of what regulatory regime should apply to the press in the future: firstly what a regulatory regime should do; secondly how it should be structured to achieve that; and thirdly the detailed rules that are put in place to achieve the objectives

CLAIM sentence:  What would be the distinguishing features of the conduct and practices of a media industry, or any organisation which was a part of that industry, which would make it an ethical one? 

CLAIM sentence:  What role might reasonably be expected to be played by a code of conduct in encouraging, inculcating or enforcing ethical behaviour by the press? What would be the distinguishing principles and features of any code of ethical conduct with universal application to the media industry? 

CLAIM sentence:  The point was made in specific connection to this Inquiry by Lord Justice Moses in the first of the challenges by Elaine Decoulos to my failure to grant her Core Participant status

CLAIM sentence:  which they were reported

CLAIM sentence:  Prior to autumn , The Sun had supported the Labour Party in the three preceding General Elections

CLAIM sentence:  For present purposes, although relevant to the issue of the impact of proprietors on editorial policy, the circumstances of that decision do not matter

CLAIM sentence:  When giving evidence, Rupert Murdoch said that after this decision had been publicised in September , he received a telephone call from the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, which included the observation by Mr Brown that your company has declared war on my government and we have no alternative but to make war on your company

CLAIM sentence:  Both in his statement and in his evidence, Mr Brown emphatically denied having any conversation with Mr Murdoch, still less making such a remark

CLAIM sentence:  When he gave evidence he said: This conversation never took place

CLAIM sentence:  There was no such conversation

CLAIM sentence:  He provided telephone records from the Downing Street switchboard (through which he says any such telephone call would have been routed) backing up this denial

CLAIM sentence:  It is possible to postulate circumstances in which the question of whether this telephone call took place was central to the resolution of civil litigation between the parties

CLAIM sentence:  In that event, considerable investigation would have focussed around the precise date and time of the alleged telephone call; questions would have been addressed to Mr Murdoch as to how he said that the call had been connected; phone records and other documents sought on discovery

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Murdoch would have been cross-examined at length by counsel for Mr Brown and vice versa

CLAIM sentence:  To do so, in particular, without permitting cross-examination seems to me to be unfair to both men

CLAIM sentence:  In short, it is neither critical nor, indeed, necessary to decide where the truth of this conversation lies: save in the limited respect of the credibility of Mr Murdoch, it is not relevant to the Terms of Reference at all

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing- -April-

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing- -June-

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, both in advance of the Inquiry and while it has been proceeding, different press titles have throughout presented the evidence and the issues (or their perception of each) and commented on the approach, asserting facts and reaching their own conclusions both as to what I have been doing and what I have been thinking

CLAIM sentence:  Some titles, conversely, have offered minimal, if any, coverage of the Inquiry for their readers

CLAIM sentence:  Very quickly, however, it became apparent that the way in which the Inquiry was being reported told its own story about the culture and practices of the press

CLAIM sentence:   For reasons which will become apparent, I take a slightly different view in relation to the disclosure of the medical condition of Mr Browns son: see Part F, Chapter   By way of example, p, http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning- Hearing--January-

CLAIM sentence:  There were submissions at the start of Module Two from Mr Jay, and also on behalf of the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and the Metropolitan Police Authority (now the Mayors Office for Policing and Crime)

CLAIM sentence:  Module Three was opened only by Mr Jay

CLAIM sentence:  In the same way, Counsel to the Inquiry and the Core Participants have assisted me with argument in relation to the rulings to which I have referred above and other issues that have arisen during the course of the hearings

CLAIM sentence:  I have referred to the questions that were posted on the Inquiry website as each module came to be discussed in the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The origin is to be found in the Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry (Cmnd , ) (the Salmon Report) which proposed, among other recommendations, that before a person was called as a witness, he should be informed of any allegations which are made against him and the substance of the evidence in support of them: thus were born Salmon letters although over-rigid adherence has been recognised as unhelpful: see the observations of Sir Richard Scott VC (in ()  LQR ) to the effect that every inquiry must adapt its procedures to meet its own circumstances

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Robert Maxwells attempt to obtain sight of proposed draft conclusions was rejected in the Court of Appeal when Lawton LJ put the matter in this way: see Maxwell v Department of Trade and Industry [] QB  at page B- D: Those who conduct inquiries have to base their decisions, findings, conclusions or opinions 

CLAIM sentence:  Notwithstanding these judicial observations, the broad process was adopted by Lord Bingham in the BCCI Inquiry, by Sir Richard Scott in the Inquiry into Matrix Churchill and also by Sir John Chilcott in the Iraq Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The second (and most extensive) protection is provided by Rules - of the Inquiry Rules  (the  Rules) which concern what are described as Warning Letters

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, Rule  provides: () The Chairman may send a warning letter to any person: (a) he considers maybe, or who has been, subject to criticism in the inquiry proceedings; or (b) about whom criticism may be inferred from evidence that has been given during the inquiry proceedings; or (c) who may be subject to criticism in the report, or any interim report

CLAIM sentence:  () The inquiry panel must not include any explicit or significant criticism of a person in the report, or in any interim report, unless (a) the chairman has sent that person a warning letter; and (b) the person has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the warning letter

CLAIM sentence:  In my ruling, I explained the ways in which I have sought to ensure that the Inquiry was conducted fairly and with full regard to the position of all who might be affected

CLAIM sentence:  I appreciate (as was argued by Mr Desmond Browne QC for Trinity Mirror plc) that this could allow anyone following the references through to the transcript to identify the titles and, perhaps, the relevant journalists; in reality, however, that would be possible whether or not I identified the references and, on the basis that I have not made specific findings in most individual cases, this approach does not offend the general principle that I am not focussing  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  If I had done otherwise, hundreds of journalists (if not more), most of whom have neither been asked nor volunteered to give evidence to the Inquiry or even to make a statement, would have had to receive a warning

CLAIM sentence:  Second, each of the major UK political parties has recognised, in general terms, that the relationship between politicians and the press has become too close: indeed, that was the conclusion expressed by the Prime Minister and his three predecessors when they gave evidence

CLAIM sentence:  The third concern has been the extent to which the work of the Inquiry has involved contemporary political issues with the risk of entering into a party political debate which is no part of its function: this particularly relates to the attempted acquisition News Corp of the publicly owned shares in BSkyB Ltd

CLAIM sentence:   In particular, in relation to the knowledge and understanding (a) in  of Surrey Police as to the interception of the mobile phone of Milly Dowler and (b) in  of Cleveland Police in relation to e mail hacking of John Darwin who had faked his own death in a canoe  http://www

CLAIM sentence:  I can deal with Module Four quite shortly

CLAIM sentence:  In this Report, each of the ideas put before the Inquiry has been subject to rigorous analysis and none more so than the proposals advanced by Lord Black of Brentwood (on behalf of the Press Board of Finance) and advocated by, among others, Lord Hunt of Wirral, the Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission

CLAIM sentence:  I appreciate that Lord Black has had to deal with a wide spread of press interest; I have no doubt that different constituents have put forward different priorities and different ideas and that, furthermore, Lord Black has done his best to bring everyone to a common consensus which I expect is also consistent with his own ideas

CLAIM sentence:  Any concern or criticism that I have of the final formulation, however, is not a criticism of him or, indeed, any other person whether individual or corporate: neither should it be seen as such

CLAIM sentence:  In those circumstances, I have not felt it appropriate or necessary to give advance warning of my concerns but have simply set them out in the body of the Report

CLAIM sentence:  The reason for the existence of Rule  of the Inquiry Rules is clear from this analysis

CLAIM sentence:  These issues are to be contrasted with those set out in Part  of the Terms of Reference, which are specifically directed to a far more fact focussed investigation of the conduct of News International and other newspaper organisations (the extent of unlawful or improper conduct, the extent of corporate governance and management failures), along with the police (the extent to which the police received corrupt payments or other inducements, or were otherwise complicit in such misconduct or in suppressing its proper investigation) and politicians (the role, if any, of politicians, public servants and others in relation to any failure to investigate wrongdoing at News International)

CLAIM sentence:  Subject to this framework, the obligation is set out in s() of the Inquiries Act  in these terms: The Chairman of an inquiry must deliver a report to the Minister setting out 

CLAIM sentence:  To that extent, the approach of at least one newspaper group to the Inquiry, restricting itself to demonstrating how illegal or unethical activity cannot be placed at its door, has wholly missed the point

CLAIM sentence:  It does not matter whether, for example, phone hacking occurred only at one title or was more widespread since it is an established problem of conduct by at least part of the press which will inform the recommendations made

CLAIM sentence:  Neither am I prepared to proceed on the basis that the argument of one rogue reporter can be replaced, by the remainder of the press, with an argument of one rogue newspaper title: if that is what I consider the position to be, I shall so conclude

CLAIM sentence:  That does not require me to decide how extensive was the practice or knowledge of phone hacking (although keeping quiet about a known abuse of the law by another title itself says something about culture, practices and ethics, on the basis that who otherwise will hold the press to account) but, in any event, illegality and unethical behaviour comes in many different forms and it is the overall picture that is critical

CLAIM sentence:  I there had regard to the Baha Mousa Inquiry conducted by The Rt Hon Sir William Gage who, referring to s() of the Inquiries Act  Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) [] AC  at  per Lord Nicholls  [] QB   []  WLR   See Re D, per Lord Carswell at para

CLAIM sentence:  A considerable body of evidence has been adduced which gives rise to reasonable grounds for believing that knowledge of the practice was linked to its use, albeit there is not the hard evidence (such as comes from the Mulcaire material) of names, telephone numbers and the like

CLAIM sentence:  It seems to me that it could be possible to conclude, inferentially, on the balance of probability, that others were involved in the practice; it might be fairer, however, (and sufficient to add to the weight of any conclusion about the need for a new approach to regulation) simply to conclude that there are strong reasonable grounds for believing that it did

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Jonathan Caplan QC for Associated Newspapers Ltd argues that any general statement that there are grounds to suspect senior executives within a section of the national press of knowledge, concealment or acquiescence in voicemail interception raised very serious reputational issues for those senior personnel reasonably considered by the public to be within that section of the press (that is to say the tabloid or popular press)

CLAIM sentence:  It is argued that such conclusions should not be reached unless the evidence discloses objectively reasonable grounds to suspect those executives which it cannot because there has been no proper investigation of the issue

CLAIM sentence:  I have not singled out senior executives for special mention but it is important to make the point that this should not and does not mean that, in appropriate cases, individual titles (and individual executives or journalists) will not be identified or identifiable

CLAIM sentence:  A similar problem arises in connection with the relationships between the press and the police (in particular in relation to the refusal to re-open investigations into mobile phone interception)

CLAIM sentence:  It has been said that I have had an agenda and that the failure to involve a journalist with tabloid or mid-market experience as an assessor demonstrates a failure to understand the popular culture of journalism and an attempt to impose a broadsheet agenda when the profitable newspapers are the former not the latter

CLAIM sentence:  Although the Prime Minister initially hoped that the Report would be available within  months, two developments affected the prospect of such a time frame being met

CLAIM sentence:  I therefore set different targets namely that the evidence should conclude within about  months of the appointment of the Inquiry and the Report should be available within about  months of the commencement of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Winston Churchill The proper functioning of a modern participatory democracy requires that the media be free, active, professional and inquiring

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Bingham 

CLAIM sentence:  The importance of a free press to democracy is surely incontrovertible, and, as Lord Binghams statement makes clear, enshrined in law and constitution in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  Why it is so may be thought obvious, but bears some consideration

CLAIM sentence:  , a case which held that any restriction on the interviewing of prisoners by journalists must be strictly justified, Lord Steyn explained at paragraph : Freedom of expression is, of course, intrinsically important: it is valued for its own sake

CLAIM sentence:  Secondly, in the famous words of Holmes J (echoing John Stuart Mill), the best of truth is the power of thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market: Abrams v US ()  U

CLAIM sentence:  Thirdly, freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy

CLAIM sentence:  The point was developed in the speech of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd ()  A

CLAIM sentence:  , at paragraph : The high importance of freedom to impart and receive information and ideas has been stated so often and so eloquently that the point calls for no elaboration in this case

CLAIM sentence: Likewise, there is no need to elaborate on the importance of the role discharged by the media in the expression and communication of information and comment on political matters

CLAIM sentence:  In Castells v Spain ()  EHHR  a senator of an opposition political party in Spain published an article in a weekly magazine critical of the government, and was charged and convicted of insulting the government and disqualified from holding political office

CLAIM sentence:  During the trial, Senor Castells attempted to adduce evidence as to the truth of the article, but it was declared inadmissible by the Spanish Supreme Court

CLAIM sentence:  State control over printing tightened when, in , Henry VIII decreed that all new printed books had to be approved by the Privy Council and registered with the Stationers Company

CLAIM sentence:  Give me the liberty to know and to utter and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties

CLAIM sentence:  In , Parliament banned reporting in print of the proceedings of either house of Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  Newspaper stamp duty was eventually abolished in 

CLAIM sentence:  The proliferation of both regional and national newspapers was followed by a period of consolidation as increasingly powerful newspaper chains bought up provincial titles

CLAIM sentence:  Representative of the type of views being expressed on this issue, but not on others, George Orwell gave the following retrospective perspective: 

CLAIM sentence:  In the final report, the Commission recognised the potential problem presented by the concentration of newspaper ownership

CLAIM sentence:  In , the Government set up a Committee under Sir David Calcutt QC to investigate growing concerns over invasions of privacy by the press

CLAIM sentence:  Its sitting in a magistrates court reporting on the daily tide of crime cases the communitys witness to the process of justice

CLAIM sentence:  Freedom for commercial mass media businesses (corporate speech) is a very different proposition from the freedom of individual self-expression (personal speech)

CLAIM sentence:  The latter is discussed further below, and has its roots in a very personal conception of what it is to be human

CLAIM sentence:  Take, for example, John Stuart Mills argument from On Liberty, that freedom of speech serves a central function in promoting individual autonomy and self-fulfilment

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore unsurprising that the proliferation of newspapers which followed the abolition of the stamp duty in the nineteenth century was accompanied by one of the most active periods of political reform in modern history

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Professor-Susan- Mendus

CLAIM sentence:  More recently, investigations conducted by his modern counterparts at The Daily Telegraph resulted in the exposure of widespread misuse of the parliamentary expenses scheme by Members of Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  Less headline grabbing, but of equal significance, is the role of investigative journalism in consumer affairs and at exposing abuses of power in publicly-run institutions such as hospitals, care homes and prisons

CLAIM sentence:  Respect for the law is the common framework within which the press, as an important commercial sector, is enabled  As a fundamental constitutional principle, the rule of law is now recognised in statute: see s  of the Constitutional Reform Act   Dr Thomas Fuller,   Bingham, T, The Rule of Law  Chapter  | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy B\xc

CLAIM sentence:  to flourish, to preserve and enjoy its freedoms, and to make its unique contribution to a democratic society

CLAIM sentence:  Even if newspapers are, as editors have forcefully suggested, merely the passive conduits of their readers views, the argument for a multiplicity of such views is clear

CLAIM sentence:  These arguments are recognised in general terms by plurality and media specific competition laws, which apply both to the print and broadcast media

CLAIM sentence:  Of course, I fully appreciate that plurality and partisanship are separate concepts; that the print media is fully entitled to be partisan; and that the broadcast media is required to be impartial

CLAIM sentence:  As explained above, the rule of law is at the most fundamental level the guarantor of the freedom of the press, not an exception to it

CLAIM sentence:   Part J Chapter   pp-, Lord Hunt, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  A free debate cannot happen if some participants simply drown out others and prevent them from speaking

CLAIM sentence:  Race hate would be no more protected in the pages of a newspaper than it would anywhere else

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Hoffmann observed in Campbell v MGN Ltd that the protection of privacy was essential to the protection of human autonomy and dignity the right to control the dissemination of information about ones private life and the right to the esteem and respect of other people

CLAIM sentence:  In the same case, Lord Nicholls agreed that [a] proper degree of privacy is essential for the wellbeing and development of an individual

CLAIM sentence:  Thus the existence of a private sphere is vital for human development

CLAIM sentence:  For example, suppose a cunning King permits dissenting political views to be expressed, but only at the bottom of a deep mine shaft

CLAIM sentence:  Though here, strictly speaking, one has an opportunity to express ones views, one is not free to have them heard

CLAIM sentence:  It can set the news agenda, shape culture and change perceptions:   There is a great deal of difference between a bloke down the pub claiming, to his fellow drinkers, that the MMR vaccine causes autism, and a broadsheet newspaper doing the same thing

CLAIM sentence:  Debate and comment, information and speculation, news and opinion, education and entertainment, all play their part

CLAIM sentence:  So, for example, we might say we wanted the TV listings and football results to be accurate; the editorial to be opinionated (perhaps to confirm or challenge, or help us form, our own opinions); the sports reporting to be lively (and reasonably fair), the travel writing to be inspiring but not misleading, the crossword to be challenging but not impossible, and so on

CLAIM sentence:  Nowhere is that more the case than in the role of the media in conveying news

CLAIM sentence:  We know that some news is more important than others, but we vary in our judgments about that

CLAIM sentence:  We have an instinct that different kinds of news should be communicated in different ways (a politicians mistake, an outbreak of disease, a missing child, a disappointing new film, another rape in the town), but we will not find it easy to articulate those differences with any great precision

CLAIM sentence:  For some, if not most, that is very much part of why it is their newspaper of choice

CLAIM sentence:  That does not mean we always agree with it

CLAIM sentence:  There will be a common expectation of complete accuracy in the TV listings; mistakes will irritate and inconvenience readers and ultimately drive them to look elsewhere

CLAIM sentence:  A newspaper urging readers to support a particular party in the run-up to a General Election can be expected to be more sympathetic to that partys outlook and objectives than anothers, and to reflect that sympathy editorially elsewhere in its pages

CLAIM sentence:  They included, for example: (a) (b) (c) (d) science and health reporting, where most non-specialist readers cannot easily judge for themselves what experts are telling us; consumer journalism such as property or travel reporting and restaurant reviewing, where we might not know whether a journalist has been an objective mystery shopper or whether he or she has in fact been treated to holidays or meals by the organisations being reviewed, or owns a property in the same square as the house being praised in the newspaper; PR journalism, in which what is effectively commercially-produced advertising material is reproduced as editorial without mediation at all; the reporting of identity issues (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, appearance and so on) where the fact and manner of bringing such issues into coverage has a potential to implant a relevance for them in readers which they have not chosen

CLAIM sentence:  In all these cases, that is to say the inaccessible expertise, the conflicts of interest, the subliminal, or the simply misleadingly incomplete, the reader cannot straightforwardly make up his or her mind about what the newspaper is saying

CLAIM sentence:  There may be cases where one has to hold back on the source of certain information,  p, http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Professor-Baroness- ONeil

CLAIM sentence:   Knowing the source of a story is relevant to how we interpret it

CLAIM sentence:  Our response to advertorials may (or at least ought to be) different from our response to news stories

CLAIM sentence:  With regard to truthfulness and other norms of communication, the arguments offered here are not that this or that claim ought to be made but rather, that the appropriate procedures and mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that what is said (whatever it is) is justifiable, assessable and evaluable with regard to its source

CLAIM sentence:  And it will support others with responsibilities for holding power to account in doing so, including in the case of the media itself

CLAIM sentence:  So you have those guiding aims of the media holding people accountable and presenting information serving those roles and then these constraints

CLAIM sentence:  It is nevertheless a point which it is important to stress once again, if only because of the seeming indefatigability of the argument in some quarters that whatever sells newspapers must ipso facto be a good thing, since newspapers are a good thing in themselves

CLAIM sentence:  However, even more critical to the existence of an ethical media organisation is culture

CLAIM sentence:  If there is an unhealthy culture then an organisation can have an ethical code but it will have little influence

CLAIM sentence:  Members of the organisation can undergo ethics training but it will have little effect

CLAIM sentence:  As soon as they return from the training to their desk or office, the pervasive culture will dominate their decision-making

CLAIM sentence:  The culture brings to bear all sorts of accepted norms which an afternoons training will be relatively powerless to affect

CLAIM sentence:  (I do not, of course, think that good ethics training is pointless, but simply that its effectiveness depends on whether, or to what extent, other factors are in place in the organisation

CLAIM sentence: ) there are a number of critical factors that could be expected to bear on ethical culture in a media organisation

CLAIM sentence:  First, tone from the top leadership is of tremendous importance

CLAIM sentence:  I was particularly interested to hear in response about Professor  p, Dr Neil Manson,http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Dr- Neil-Manson

CLAIM sentence:  I do not mean a media industry driven by ethical goals in the way that a charity like Oxfam is

CLAIM sentence:  In my view media organisations are ethical if they genuinely try to communicate in ways that enable intended audiences to understand and to assess what they publish, while respecting the legitimate claims of those on whom they comment and of those affected by their reporting

CLAIM sentence:  To meet them the media need not only to refrain from unlawful speech acts (threatening, bribing, defaming, breaches of data protection, breaches of confidentiality and many others) but to meet adequate ethical and epistemic standards in journalistic, editorial and business practice

CLAIM sentence:  There is a need for an aspirational code, not simply a list of prohibitions against failings which those in the media fall into

CLAIM sentence:  To make a code a lived code, media organisations need to attend to the critical factors that can bring about an ethical organisation, or promote integrity in an organisation

CLAIM sentence:  These factors include tone from the top (or leadership), an open and honest culture, and so on

CLAIM sentence:  Part of developing such an ethically reflective organisation might be to introduce governance reports which press/media would produce annually, writing such reports in light of the requirements of the code

CLAIM sentence:  Any such governance reporting would need to avoid either being overburdensome or being a mere ritual in order to be both effective and meaningful  In order for a code of conduct to be properly effective it has to be, not only coherent and justified in terms of its normative content, but such that there is something about the social, institutional, legal or practical context that motivates and secures compliance

CLAIM sentence: I would argue that Britains commercially viable free press, because its in hock to nobody, is the only real free media in this country

CLAIM sentence:  I have always been keenly aware of the dangers of going too far; and I have been continually reminded as the Inquiry has progressed

CLAIM sentence:  In short, it has not been difficult for me to remain alive to this critical risk

CLAIM sentence:  I go further

CLAIM sentence:  This Part of the Report looks at the market for news provision and some of the ways in which it is changing as well as the newspaper market more generally

CLAIM sentence:  This Chapter looks briefly at the economics of the newspaper market and where the challenges are coming from

CLAIM sentence:  C Chapter  looks at the main players in the newspaper industry, including a brief review of the history of each where relevant, the financial and commercial performance of each and the governance and compliance processes in place at each title

CLAIM sentence:  This is all important background in order to understand the differences, if any, between the cultures and practices of individual titles and publishers

CLAIM sentence:  The Chapter also looks briefly at the markets for regional and local newspapers and for magazines, drawing, in particular, on evidence that the Inquiry has heard from specific titles

CLAIM sentence:  There is no attempt at a detailed analysis of these markets; this is not needed for the subsequent consideration of the issues at the heart of this inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  It is undeniable that the market in which newspapers compete has changed substantially over recent decades and continues to change rapidly

CLAIM sentence:  The rise of digital broadcasting and the internet mean that UK citizens now have a much broader range of news and media providers offering news coverage, current affairs and entertainment than ever before; and newspapers have to compete in this market both for advertising revenue and for readership

CLAIM sentence:  The result is that newspapers have a significantly smaller reach than they did  years ago, to say nothing of  years ago, and are operating in a media environment in which consumers and citizens have very different expectations of standards from different types of media

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst newspapers are losing their share of the market, the costs of producing the news are not reducing significantly and much of the competition on the internet comes from organisations which are not, themselves, the originators of news content

CLAIM sentence:  Newspaper economics The media landscape in  is very different from that which Sir David Calcutt QC looked at when he made his recommendations that led to the establishment of the PCC in 

CLAIM sentence:  Then, the internet did not exist as a consumer medium, UK citizens had access to only four terrestrial TV channels, BBC, BBC, ITV and Channel , and satellite broadcasting had only just begun and was accessed by only a tiny minority of families

CLAIM sentence:  On the radio, citizens could listen to the (then) four BBC national radio stations (only joined midway through  by Radio ), local BBC radio and  commercial local radio stations

CLAIM sentence:  This meant that, in reality, most people had a choice of only two different radio providers

CLAIM sentence:  Regional and local press circulation (for paid-for papers) was nearly  million in total

CLAIM sentence:  The UK citizen therefore had limited sources of news and was heavily dependent on newspapers; broadcast media was limited to a very narrow range of broadcasters, with TV broadcasters, at least, having a public service remit in respect of news

CLAIM sentence:  The citizen today has a very wide range of sources of national, international and local news and comment, in a world of ever growing media complexity

CLAIM sentence:  Virtually every UK household has digital TV, providing a profusion of channels, including four free-to-view  hour news channels and others available with subscription

CLAIM sentence:  There are now  national radio channels, and  local radio stations, all of which will carry some form of news

CLAIM sentence:  Against this growing digital activity, newspaper circulation has fallen significantly, as shown by the table below

CLAIM sentence:  The national daily newspaper circulation stood at 

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst other media sectors are now showing recovery from the recession, that is not the case with newspapers and magazines

CLAIM sentence:  Newspaper and magazine revenues come from three sources: copy sales revenue, display advertising and classified advertising

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, advertising spend has historically declined when growth in the economy is slow, adding further pressures on newspaper revenues

CLAIM sentence:  All of this means that newspapers face significant economic pressures

CLAIM sentence:  However, whilst newspapers revenues have fallen for most publishing groups in the last five years, the different ownership and operation structures within the industry mean that the impact of these pressures is different

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly there has been no structural like-for-like shift in advertising revenues for newspapers from print to online editions

CLAIM sentence:  It is certainly telling and illustrative of the challenges faced by newspapers that the UKs most successful online newspapers, the MailOnline and the Guardian, have yet to find a way of converting this into substantial or comparable profit

CLAIM sentence:  However, recent changes to the law restricting the use of cookies and other tracking technologies without the informed consent of the user may further dilute the potential revenues that a newspaper or other business may derive from this source

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has been told that circulation may be boosted temporarily, through price cutting or promotional campaigns, but these do not generally have a long term impact and circulation levels tend to fall back once the promotional activity is discontinued

CLAIM sentence:   pp-, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard different interpretations of the impact of these economic pressures on newspaper business models

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has been told that the economic difficulties have not affected training of journalists

CLAIM sentence:  The impact on regional newspapers has been more severe, with a number of titles merging or closing

CLAIM sentence:  For example, the Trinity Mirror portfolio of regional newspapers has fallen from  titles to 

CLAIM sentence:  Two UK daily titles (the Financial Times and the Times) operate behind paywalls but this is not necessarily seen as a solution that can work across the industry

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction In this Chapter I examine the history, governance structures and finances of the major British newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  I will look first and in some detail at those newspapers owned by News International (NI), and ultimately by the parent company in the US, News Corporation

CLAIM sentence:  This is fitting given the central role of the News of the World (NoTW) in the events that led to establishment of this Inquiry, as well as the extraordinary influence that Rupert Murdoch has exercised over the development of the press in Britain, since he purchased NoTW newspaper in 

CLAIM sentence:  I will then look at the history, governance structures and finances of the other major British newspaper publishing houses, before turning albeit briefly to the regional press and the magazine industry

CLAIM sentence: \t News\tCorporation 

CLAIM sentence:  Group history and context News Corporation (News Corp) was founded in  as a holding company for Mr Murdochs Australian newspaper business, News Ltd, to manage News Ltds growing portfolio of international assets particularly in the United Kingdom and the US

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Murdoch is both the Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corp which, as of , is the worlds second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, and the third largest in terms of entertainment

CLAIM sentence:  Although News Corp was initially incorporated in South Australia, reflecting the Australian origins of the business, in November  the company was re-incorporated under Delaware Corporation Law

CLAIM sentence:  News Corp is now listed on the NASDAQ and has secondary listings on the Australian Securities Exchange

CLAIM sentence:  News Corp now has global reach, and in addition to its holdings in its traditional British, American and Australian newspaper markets, it has substantial operations in India, Italy, Germany, Brazil and Hong Kong that span both traditional media as well as new media, telecommunications and the internet

CLAIM sentence:  Group governance News Corp is headquartered in New York

CLAIM sentence:  The News Corp Board of Directors is made up  directors and includes those in executive and non-executive capacities

CLAIM sentence:  The Board sets the strategic direction for News Corp and its subsidiaries and is responsible for the corporate governance of the company

CLAIM sentence:  June  News Corp announced that it intends to pursue the separation of its publishing and media and entertainment businesses into two distinct publicly traded companies

CLAIM sentence:  Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud of Saudi Arabia owns % of News Corps shares through his Kingdom Holding Company, making him the second largest shareholder in News Corp

CLAIM sentence:  The Management and Standards Committee News Corp established the Management and Standards Committee (MSC) to take responsibility for all matters in relation to phone hacking at NoTW, payments to the police and all other related issues at NI

CLAIM sentence:  The MSC is autonomous from News Corp and NI

CLAIM sentence:  It works to ensure full co-operation with all investigations into these issues, including this Inquiry, the police inquiries, civil proceedings and Parliamentary hearings

CLAIM sentence:  The MSC is authorised to conduct internal investigations to fulfil its responsibilities in relation to NIs papers: The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times

CLAIM sentence:  It has power to direct NI staff to co- operate fully with all external and internal investigations, and to preserve, obtain and disclose appropriate documents

CLAIM sentence:  An important part of the MSC role is to recommend and oversee the implementation of new policies and systems to ensure that editorial practices at NIs titles meet the highest standards

CLAIM sentence:  The MSC originally reported to Joel Klein, Executive Vice-President and a director of News Corp, but at the time of writing, reports to Gerson Zweifach, Senior Executive Vice-President and Group General Counsel of News Corp, who in turn report to the independent directors on the News Corp Board through Professor Viet Dinh, an independent Director on the News Corp Board of Directors

CLAIM sentence:  News Corp estimates its global assets to be worth some $

CLAIM sentence:  Its financial results reflect the global scale of the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  In , it reported a turnover $

CLAIM sentence: bn, an % increase on its turnover for 

CLAIM sentence:  In , this had risen further to 

CLAIM sentence:  News Corp posted profits of $

CLAIM sentence: com/corp_gov/MSC

CLAIM sentence: com/corp_gov/MSC_reporting_structure

CLAIM sentence:  Although newspapers were once central to the News Corp business model this is no longer the case

CLAIM sentence:  In the / financial year, newspapers accounted for just % of News Corps overall profit

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, in , newspapers had contributed to % of News Corps total profits

CLAIM sentence:  In  New Corps television businesses provided around % percent of the companys total profit

CLAIM sentence:  The company reported a $ million pre-tax charge related to its British newspaper business

CLAIM sentence:  However, details of the  event in Pebble Beach were leaked together with an agenda to the Los Angeles Times

CLAIM sentence:  According to that newspaper, agenda items ranged from discussions on Europe, to broadcasting and new media and terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  News Corporations UK newspaper interests are held by its wholly-owned subsidiary, NI, which is the parent company both of Times Newspapers Holdings Ltd (TNHL) and of News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN)

CLAIM sentence:  NGN is the publisher of The Sun and The Sun on Sunday, and formerly published NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  However, the title struggled financially and did not make a profit

CLAIM sentence:  It was closed on  November 

CLAIM sentence:  The London Paper, an evening freesheet published fives times each week, was distributed at bus and railway stations across London

CLAIM sentence:  In September  the paper closed in the face of intense competition from the other free titles distributed in London, including the Metro, the London Lite and the Evening Standard

CLAIM sentence: com/investor/stock_quotes

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Thomas- Mockridge

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Murdoch made clear his view in an interview with the title ahead of the launch of The Sun on Sunday that the new Sunday edition of the paper would be family orientated and ethical

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, in his evidence to the Inquiry, the current editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, expressed his firmly held belief that The Sun is a powerful force for good, and cited the work undertaken by the paper to enable its poorest readers to afford holidays as well as its recent work in schools promoting science learning

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Murdoch described NoTW as: a campaigning newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  certainly it was interested in celebrities, just as the public is, and a much greater investment went into covering the weekend soccer

CLAIM sentence:  Salacious gossip? Meaning I take gossip as meaning unfounded stories about celebrities: no

CLAIM sentence:  I certainly hope not

CLAIM sentence:  NI has described The Times as renowned for its ability to deliver accurate, intelligent and engaging information

CLAIM sentence:  Both The Times and The Sunday Times have a long and established a reputation for quality investigative journalism, particularly The Sunday Times Insight Team, which has been responsible for stories such as the exposure of the spy scandal relating to the MI agent Kim Philby, the scandal of Thalidomide, as well as more recent allegations of vote rigging at FIFA

CLAIM sentence:  News International history: News Group 

CLAIM sentence:  NoTW was purchased by Rupert Murdoch in January 

CLAIM sentence:  The Sun, which had been launched by the International Publishing Corporation (IPC) in , was acquired by Mr Murdoch in October 

CLAIM sentence:  At the time of its acquisition The Sun was almost bankrupt

CLAIM sentence:  Changes to content, and in particular the introduction of a far more irreverent and informal style, as well as changes to editorial policy and production methods, led to a dramatic turnaround in the newspapers fortunes

CLAIM sentence:  Within three years, The Sun newspaper was not only highly profitable, providing much of the necessary finance for further acquisitions elsewhere, but was successfully challenging the Daily Mirror as the UKs best selling newspaper

CLAIM sentence: uk/sol/homepage/news//Its-Sun-day-Were-launching-new-edition-of-Britains-No- newspaper

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of- Morning-Hearing--April-

CLAIM sentence:  In an otherwise staid newspaper market, the re-launched The Sun and NoTW were irreverent and anti-establishment

CLAIM sentence:  The Keeler article certainly boosted sales, although Mr Murdoch received much criticism from his competitors of reporting old news, especially of such a nature

CLAIM sentence:  The Sun under Mr Murdoch set out to appeal to a broader cross-section of society

CLAIM sentence:  This marked the first anniversary of the re-launched tabloid and quickly became a controversial trademark of the paper, albeit copied by its competitors

CLAIM sentence:  During this period, the circulation of The Sun increased from  million in  to over 

CLAIM sentence:  million in , peaking at  million in  under Sir Larry Lambs editorship

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Murdoch was not only responsible for the introduction of a new approach to tabloid journalism at both The Sun and NoTW, he also introduced important changes to methods of production to all his titles

CLAIM sentence:  Irrespective of any political support, the changes implemented by Mr Murdoch set a precedent: within two years of the conclusion of the strike, most of the national papers had followed NIs lead, left Fleet Street, and changed their printing practices

CLAIM sentence:  Although both The Sun and NI are conservative in outlook, the political loyalties of neither paper have been set in stone

CLAIM sentence:  Some commentators have argued that so influential has the tabloid become that it is able to decide the outcome of elections

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly, that was the clear inference of The Suns front page headline following the Conservative election victory in April , It was The Sun wot won it

CLAIM sentence:  Although The Sun and NoTW backed the Labour Party in the ,  and  general elections, the relationship between the New Labour Government and the NI titles had grown  Page, B, The Murdoch Archipelago, p  ibid, p  Audit Bureau of Circulations, cited in Page, B, The Murdoch Archipelago, p  Snoddy, R, The Good, the Bad, and the Unacceptable: The hard news about the British press, pp-  ibid, p  Discussed in detail in Part I Chapter   Chapter  | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C\xcincreasingly strained

CLAIM sentence:  It is reported that ahead of the  election, Mr Murdoch had said that Tony Blair deserved one last chance

CLAIM sentence:  In late September , on the day of Gordon Browns keynote speech to the Labour Party Conference, The Sun announced that it would support the Conservative Party in the  election

CLAIM sentence:  The detail of the relationship between Mr Murdoch and politicians, including how that influenced the editorial stance of his newspapers, is considered in detail in Part I 

CLAIM sentence:  The Sun now has the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK, selling approximately 

CLAIM sentence:  The first edition of The Sun on Sunday achieved sales of 

CLAIM sentence:  News International history: Times Newspapers Holdings Limited 

CLAIM sentence:  TNHL was established in  when the Thomson Corporation purchased The Times from the Astor family and merged it with The Sunday Times

CLAIM sentence:  Under Section  of the Fair Trading Act  any newspaper merger at the time required the consent of the Secretary of State for Trade

CLAIM sentence:  The Thomson Organisation imposed deadlines beyond which they said they would no longer support The Times ( March ) or The Sunday Times ( March )

CLAIM sentence:  The then Secretary of State, John Biffen, told Parliament that this factor, taken together with the financial figures for the two newspapers, convinced him that neither title was economic as a going concern and that to require an MMC reference would risk the closure of both titles, the loss of , jobs and the possibility of the permanent closure of The Times

CLAIM sentence:  Seventh, subject only to any annual budget for editorial space and expenditure the editor shall retain control over the appointment, disposition and dismissal of journalists on his newspaper and of all other content of his newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  Those conditions are included within the Articles of Association of Times Holdings Limited and still bind the company today

CLAIM sentence:  For example, Geoffrey Robertson MP said: In his first major decision the Right Hon

CLAIM sentence:  Gentleman has failed to stand up to the Prime Minister

CLAIM sentence:  I shall examine the facts and show why later

CLAIM sentence:  This is a straightforward pay-off for services rendered by The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  If it is not, let us see the facts and figures to show that I am wrong

CLAIM sentence:  Despite this opposition the deal had the support of the editorial staff and the unions, and went ahead

CLAIM sentence:  The purchase gave NI more than a % share of daily newspaper circulation and something over % of the Sunday market

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, on occasion The Times and The Sunday Times have backed different parties

CLAIM sentence:  Most recently, The Times supported the Labour Party in ,  and  and the Conservatives in 

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, The Sunday Times supported the Conservative Party at each of those elections

CLAIM sentence:  This approach is not usual for UK newspapers, and The Times has the smallest online audience of any of the major UK newspapers: as of March  it was reported to have only , subscribers

CLAIM sentence:  This compares poorly to the Guardians website which attracts upwards of three million unique users each day and the Daily Mail website which receives in excess of  million hits each day

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry was told that in October  the Board included a News Corp representative and that a second would shortly be appointed

CLAIM sentence:  Subsequently, the Inquiry was informed that both Mr Murdoch and Janet Nova, Deputy Group General Counsel of News Corp, have stepped down from the NI board

CLAIM sentence:  Thomas Mockridge told the Inquiry that no NI executives sit on the News Corp Board: I am satisfied that notwithstanding these changes to the board, the appropriate oversight of the News International business is being maintained both at the local division and group levels and the board of directors of NI Group Limited continues to play a key role in ensuring the appropriate corporate governance standards of the company and its subsidiaries

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Mockridge told the Inquiry the NI Board has undertaken a review of compliance since July 

CLAIM sentence:  In  such audits were planned at NI in relation to, inter alia, advertising revenue, circulation revenue, compliance with the UK Bribery Act and NIs digital media operations

CLAIM sentence:  A majority of the Independent National Directors is required for the appointment and dismissal of the editors of either of the titles or the disposal by NI of the titles

CLAIM sentence:  The TNHL Board meets quarterly and the editors of The Times and The Sunday Times attend and are expected to account for editorial coverage to the Board

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent Directors meet regularly with the Editor of The Times both at board meetings of TNHL and separately to discuss any on-going issues at the paper, and with the Editor of The Sunday Times

CLAIM sentence:  There are separate boards for Times Newspapers, News Group Newspapers and NI Trading, which meet as required

CLAIM sentence:  NI is now only a small but still important part of News Corps global business

CLAIM sentence:  Although The Sun is highly profitable, the relative profitability of the group has been in decline for a number of years

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, The Times and The Sunday Times have run at a loss for a number of years and have not made a profit since 

CLAIM sentence:  However, the decline in revenues at TNHL appears to have been halted though not fully reversed

CLAIM sentence:  TNHL reported a pre-tax loss of m for the financial year / compared with a pre-tax loss of

CLAIM sentence:  The Times and The Sunday Times are guaranteed editorial independence pursuant to the  undertakings

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, Mr Murdoch takes an active interest in the editorial direction of the NGN titles, though the position in relation to The Sun and NoTW was far from identical

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that: I never much interfere with the News of the World, Im sorry to say, but that he would exercise editorial control on major issues, such as the support for parties at a general election or policy on Europe

CLAIM sentence:  In particular this departments audits cover the Editorial Commissioning System, Casual Management System (by which casual staff are paid), expenses system and NewsPeople

CLAIM sentence:  The detail of News Corps ownership of satellite television broadcaster BSkyB is dealt with in detail in the context of its recent bid for full ownership of BSkyB

CLAIM sentence:  However, at this stage I examine the early involvement of News Corp in satellite broadcasting in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  NI acquired % of the struggling Satellite Television Ltd in  for a nominal  and re- launched the company as the Sky Channel

CLAIM sentence:  Problems with the satellite technology meant that it was primarily a cable channel in the UK until , when it moved to the newly launched Astra Satellite, based in Luxembourg, which made reception in the UK much easier, and its four channels were marketed primarily to the UK

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) awarded a DBS (Direct Broadcasting via Satellite) service licence to British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) in late 

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC had also proposed its own satellite service, going as far as signing a heads of agreement on the construction of two satellites in March , but this service never launched

CLAIM sentence:  This meant that the two satellite services being marketed to the UK ran on different technical standards and needed different dishes (and different receivers) so that they were placed in direct competition with each other for customers who would only be able to receive one service or the other

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Gordon-Smart

CLAIM sentence:  In  the Broadcasting Bill was introduced to Parliament, which contained provisions relating to the licensing of satellite services

CLAIM sentence:  During debate on the Bill amendments were proposed to extend cross media ownership restrictions to the holders of a domestic or non domestic satellite service

CLAIM sentence:  These amendments were defeated and the Act became law without any cross media ownership provisions affecting the holders of satellite broadcast licences

CLAIM sentence:  In November , within days of the Broadcasting Act  receiving Royal Assent but before the regulatory changes had taken effect, it was announced that BSB and Sky were going to merge

CLAIM sentence:  At the time, the merger was covered by the Broadcasting Act , under which BSBs direct broadcasting satellite service was provided under a contract with the International Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the regulator at the time

CLAIM sentence:  In the event this proved immaterial as the merged company then broadcast solely from the Astra satellite, thus removing the need for an IBA licence

CLAIM sentence:  The merger also took the newly formed company out of the full licensing regime that the  Act would have imposed on BSB as a domestic satellite service

CLAIM sentence:  For over a decade BSkyB provided the only satellite broadcasting service directed primarily at UK viewers

CLAIM sentence:  The service was available only with subscription, and with a combination of strong marketing and exclusive programming the proportion of households with Sky subscriptions grew from the extremely low levels in  to nearly six million in , and over ten million in 

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC moved to make its channels available free to air from satellite in  but, as they were the only channels being broadcast from the satellite without encryption and therefore free to view, take up was limited

CLAIM sentence:  Over subsequent years ITV and Channel  joined the BBC in offering free to air satellite broadcasts, and Sky added a freesat from Sky offer which allows consumers to take free to air satellite services from Sky

CLAIM sentence:  BSkyB is now a significant part of News Corps direct satellite broadcasting business, which consists of the whole of SKY Italia, which now has  million subscribers, 

CLAIM sentence:  Direct Satellite broadcasting is a relatively small part of News Corps activities, contributing only

CLAIM sentence:  He has told the Inquiry that: I have turned down editorships of The Times and The Telegraph

CLAIM sentence:  One reason I did so is that at the Mail I enjoy total freedom from proprietorial and managerial interference, a freedom that is not necessarily found in other newspaper groups

CLAIM sentence:  Echoing the importance of the commercial interests of the Express Groups owner, the current editor of the Daily Express, Hugh Whittow, has told the Inquiry that his priority for the title is to keep it: buoyant, popular and profitable, and hopefully keep and encourage more readers

CLAIM sentence:  The Daily Express has traditionally supported the Conservative Party

CLAIM sentence:  Although the paper backed the Labour Party in the  general election under the editorship of Rosie Boycott, the paper returned its support to the Conservative Party ahead of the  general election

CLAIM sentence:  The then editor, Peter Hill, explained the reason for that change in allegiance to the Inquiry: the entire history of the Daily Express had been that of a right-of-centre newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  It has an enormous constituency of readers who supported that view, and I felt that it had been a huge mistake to move the newspaper to support the Labour Party, which had been done by previous editors and administrations, and it had, in fact, cost the newspaper an enormous number of readers who had abandoned it in despair

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Morgan told the Inquiry that he: speak[s] to Mr Corke on a regular basis to make sure that if we are instructing a search agency, we are doing the right thing

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has not heard any evidence to suggest that the Express Newspaper titles have implemented a formal whistle-blowing policy

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Embley has told the Inquiry that this was a personal decision, linked to the wider re-launch of the title, following his promotion to the position of editor in May 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Embley stressed the importance of the Peoples independent position, and explained to the Inquiry that: My move to political independence, I think, says quite a lot about where I stand on my view is that I represent and my paper represents the views of its readers, and my view on why I moved it to be politically independent is because I think politics has changed so much and the parties are so closely aligned on so many policy issues that it seems wrong to me just to follow one party

CLAIM sentence:  Reflecting the corporate and editorial independence of the role, this cannot be amended by the newspapers editor

CLAIM sentence:  To this extent, Mr Elliott has stressed to the Inquiry that: 

CLAIM sentence: obviously you listen carefully to that [view of the Editor], but if, in the end, you think its the right thing to do, you can fall back on the fact that you are employed by the Trust -- Im employed by the Trust and I actually think theyre wrong and we go ahead and I do what I see fit

CLAIM sentence:  The managing editor of IPL and Evening Standard Limited is responsible for the IPLs company strategy

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent editorial independence 

CLAIM sentence:  There is complete editorial independence from the Board

CLAIM sentence:  The governance of the Board is concerned primarily with the financial management of the business

CLAIM sentence:  managing editor, Andrew Mullins explains that: we separate commercial and editorial to create clear editorial independence

CLAIM sentence:  However, there are instances where editorial issues might be raised at Board level and Mr Blackhurst has also told the Inquiry that as the editor he is fully aware of the companys overall business strategy

CLAIM sentence:   Mr Mullins explained that there are occasionally scenarios where costs related to the editorial structure are impacted; or where sales would significantly fall

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Mullins explained that in these instances, discussion of editorial processes would be  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C\xcdiscussed at board level, although there would never be any discussion in relation to the editorial content

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blackhurst also told the Inquiry that The Independent has always sought to adopt a deliberately distinct approach to other national titles and continues to operate free from proprietorial influence

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Lebedev emphasised that although he might on occasion share his expectations and personal vision with his editors on a regular basis, he has no influence on the editorial content of his newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  He explained to the Inquiry that: we certainly discuss policies, and I certainly expect it to be taken into account, but to answer your question, there have been many instances when weve discussed particular issues, stories, policies and editors would have stuck with their original plan to write whatever they were planning to write

CLAIM sentence:  Manish Malhotra, the IPLs current Finance Director and Company Secretary of Evening Standard Limited told the Inquiry that these procedures reflect the: separation between editorial and commercial for that reason its very important that editorial payments are going through the overall corporate and financial governance of the company so that we have clear sight of whats being paid and whos being paid

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Malhotra told the Inquiry that there are no mechanisms in place which allow for journalists or other IPL members of staff to make cash payments

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blackhurst told the Inquiry that it would have been unlikely for The Independent to have introduced this revised Code, were it not for the exposure of phone hacking and other practices across the British National press

CLAIM sentence:  The IPLs Finance Director and Company Secretary has explained that the document goes further than the PCC Code, that: its a wider document because it covers both commercial and editorial operations

CLAIM sentence:  However, as well as covering anti-bribery it also covers business relationships, social media and data protection

CLAIM sentence:  This policy was explained to the Inquiry by Mr Blackhurst in the context of the disciplinary action that has been taken against Johann Hari, a former journalist at The Independent

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hari was accused of plagiarism and producing derogatory comments about fellow journalists on the Wikipedia website

CLAIM sentence:  Staff and external contributors are required by contract to comply with both the law and with the PCC Code

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blackhurst has acknowledged that payments are sometimes made for tip-offs for stories carried in The Independents diary page but Mr Blackhurst also stated that he exercises considerable caution with information received in this way

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that the Independent would: only pay, as a point of principle, if subsequently the story checked out

CLAIM sentence:  You wouldnt be agreeing and paying Thats not how it works

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blackhurst described The Independent as a relatively small newsroom

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blackhurst said that The Independent does not have enough resources to merit the appointment of a readers editor at the title

CLAIM sentence:  Checks are made by the original reporter, the news editor, the deputy editor and finally the editor, having been through legal scrutiny

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blackhurst told the Inquiry that: Im with the news editor, the foreign editor, the deputy editor pretty much all day long, and theyre around me, and its not a case of formal up and down the line requests

CLAIM sentence:  If I want to ask a reporter: Wheres the story come from? Ill ask them

CLAIM sentence:  I wont wait for the deputy editor to speak to the news editor to speak to the reporter

CLAIM sentence:  The Financial Times focuses on the detailed and impartial reporting of business and financial issues

CLAIM sentence:  Lionel Barber, current editor of the Financial Times, told the Inquiry that as a consequence of this focus, that paper avoids the more populist news items which might be given space in other parts of the UK press

CLAIM sentence:  In February  the FT had a UK circulation of ,, making it the third largest selling broadsheet newspaper in the UK after the Daily Telegraph and The Times, giving the FT some 

CLAIM sentence:  Governance structures FTL is wholly owned by Pearson Group and as such both the Chief Executive and the editor report to the Chief Executive of Pearson Group

CLAIM sentence:  The editor of the Financial Times is appointed by the Chief Executive of Pearson Group, who is also the only person who can remove him or her

CLAIM sentence:  On financial matters the editor reports to the Chief Executive of the FT

CLAIM sentence:  The editor of the FT, Mr Barber, has made it clear in evidence to the Inquiry that there is no editorial involvement by Pearson

CLAIM sentence:  The Chief Executive of the FT has said that reporting to Pearson provides a further layer of governance, but no additional information has been provided on how that relationship works in practice

CLAIM sentence:  The FT incorporates the Editors Code of Practice into employee contracts and has further, additional requirements in relation to financial reporting and share ownership

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry was told that management are not aware of any breaches of the Editors Code of Practice at the FT

CLAIM sentence:  To this effect he told the Inquiry that: the reason we set such a high bar is that our relationship with our readers -- and they are largely in business and finance, but not exclusively, and diplomacy and academia is one of trust

CLAIM sentence:  People have to be able to rely on the Financial Times for accurate information which is set in context, multiple sourced and that they can rely on it because theyre making decisions, important decisions in their respective professions

CLAIM sentence:  The news editor is responsible for ensuring that the relevant editorial checks are made in the FT newsroom

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Barber has described the position of the news editor at the FT as one the most critical appointments that I can make as editor

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Barber told the Inquiry that the FT does not offer a similar whistle blowing hotline for breaches of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Of course, employees are entitled to use the Pearson hotline to raise any concerns they might have, but Mr Barber said that he would expect any issues in relation to such breaches to be brought to the attention of senior management directly

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard Mr Barber told the Inquiry that: I think the FT should be the gold standard in journalism, and that means that we need to uphold the highest practices, the highest standards of integrity, and that is why we have the Investment Register and why we want to have full compliance from our journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst the editorial management team is responsible for ensuring editorial staff adhere to the PCC Code of Practice, other policies such as the companys anti-bribery policy are the responsibility of the Company Secretariat team

CLAIM sentence:  Its operation is entirely separate from all editorial responsibilities which lie with the editor

CLAIM sentence:  The FTs finance team is responsible for overseeing the processes of expenses and invoice payments

CLAIM sentence:  It is the role of the managing editor to ensure the management of the editorial budget, staff management and the general departmental administration of the newsroom

CLAIM sentence:  Financial incentives for the Chief Executive are linked to circulation and profitability of the group

CLAIM sentence:  The top  publishers account for % of all regional press titles and % of total weekly circulation

CLAIM sentence:  (below) sets out the twenty most significant regional newspaper groups measured both by weekly circulation and by the number of titles published

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the regional print titles there are also over , websites and hundreds of other print, digital and broadcast channels produced by local and regional media groups

CLAIM sentence:  The regional and local newspaper industry also has a significant economic footprint

CLAIM sentence:  The four largest regional newspaper groups had revenues in  of ,m, with total sales and advertising revenue across the industry of ,m

CLAIM sentence:  However, the regional and local newspapers market has been in significant decline for a number of years

CLAIM sentence:  Annual regional newspaper circulation has fallen from just under 

CLAIM sentence:  The factors considered to contribute to this decline in circulation include: increasing access to, and adoption of, internet information sources: economic conditions; and lack of engagement with print media by young adults

CLAIM sentence:  The decline in circulation has been matched by a decline in revenue

CLAIM sentence:  Print newspapers have two main sources of income copy sales and advertising

CLAIM sentence:  The local and regional press tend to rely much more heavily on classified advertising than do the nationals, with classified advertising accounting for % of revenues among the regional press but only 

CLAIM sentence:  All three forms of revenue have been under significant pressure over recent years

CLAIM sentence:  The net result of these changes is that revenues in regional and local newspaper publishing have been very hard hit

CLAIM sentence:  Trinity Mirrors regional division saw revenues fall by % between  and , while Newquest has seen revenues fall by % over the same timeframe and Northcliffe has seen its revenues fall by %

CLAIM sentence:  Johnston Press appears to have suffered less over the period, with revenues falling only by %, but it is clear that conditions for regional and local newsgroups are very difficult

CLAIM sentence:  Despite this bleak picture, regional news provision remains essentially profitable, with the three of the top four regional newspaper groups for which figures are available posting profits of m between them in 

CLAIM sentence:  Sly Bailey, then Chief Executive of Trinity Mirror, told the Inquiry that, in between her submission of written evidence to the Inquiry on  October , and her appearance at the Inquiry on  January , the company had reduced the number of regional titles it publishes from  to 

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Bailey indicated that Trinity Mirrors regional business was facing structural challenges, with the competition from the internet and the proliferation of new connected devices, as well as cyclical challenges from the state of the economy

CLAIM sentence:  This picture was echoed by editors of regional newspaper in their evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Maria McGeoghan, editor of the Trinity Mirror Regional title, the Manchester Evening News, told the Inquiry that: circulation on the Manchester Evening News and the paid for weekly titles is declining, but our website has got 

CLAIM sentence:  These have included: changes in the rules governing statutory notices; local authorities publishing their own free newssheets, in particular where they are partially advertising funded; and the media merger rules as they apply to the transfer of ownership of newspaper at the regional and local level

CLAIM sentence:  This last issue is considered to be the most significant and was raised by Mr Bailey in her evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The exigencies of the economic and structural problems faced by the regional newspaper industry have led to a substantial extent to groups looking to consolidate and rationalise their holdings

CLAIM sentence:  Savings can be achieved where titles that are geographically close can achieve synergies through working together

CLAIM sentence:  This has led to regional newspaper groups looking to consolidate their holdings, in particular with an eye to geographical rationalisation

CLAIM sentence:  The regional newspaper industry has been concerned that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is inclined to consider proposals for newspaper mergers in the context of the local newspaper market only, rather than taking account of the wider competition from, in particular, internet services

CLAIM sentence:  This, the industry argues, leads to potential regional newspaper transfers that could allow titles that would otherwise be uneconomic and may have to close to survive under different ownership

CLAIM sentence:  In  the OFT conducted a review of the media merger regime as it applies to local and regional newspapers, and concluded that: the current merger regime, which is broadly the same for newspapers as for other industries, is well placed to take into account developments such as competition from the internet because it is evidence-based and capable of reflecting market realities

CLAIM sentence:  The OFT has therefore recommended that no legislative changes are needed to the media merger regime

CLAIM sentence:  The OFT proposes that it will formally seek Ofcoms view in future newspaper merger cases, given its specific sector knowledge in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  The first proposed regional newspaper transaction since this new process involving Ofcom was introduced was the proposal of the Kent Messenger Group to acquire seven local weekly titles from Northcliffe Media Limited

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom conducted a Local Media Assessment which found that the merger may provide the opportunity to rationalise costs, maintain quality and investment, and provide a sounder commercial base from which to address long-term structural change

CLAIM sentence:  Within a month of the OFT decision Northcliffe had announced the closure of two of the titles concerned, the Medway News and the East Kent Gazette

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to regional and local newspapers, I do not make a specific recommendation but I suggest that the Government should look urgently as what action it might be able take to help safeguard the ongoing viability of this much valued and important part of the British press

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear to me that local, high-quality and trusted newspapers are good for our communities, our identity and our democracy and play an important social role

CLAIM sentence:  I should also, perhaps, make it clear that the regulatory model proposed later in this Report should not provide an added burden to the regional and local press

CLAIM sentence:  There are some , consumer titles in the UK (this is separate from the , business to business magazines)

CLAIM sentence:  The magazine industry has a value of 

CLAIM sentence:  Of the seven consumer magazines that have circulation of over a million, four are supermarket magazines, two are TV listings magazines and the other is the National Trust Magazine

CLAIM sentence:  The magazines classified by ABC as womens interest weeklies include some of those best known for their coverage of celebrities and celebrity lifestyles

CLAIM sentence:  According to the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA) magazines are read by % of the population and, unlike newspapers, are particularly popular among the young, with at least % of - year olds reading a magazine

CLAIM sentence:  Whereas newspapers are essentially ephemeral, and understandably have developed a reputation as tomorrows fish and chip wrappers, magazines are kept and referred to because they are considered to be a trusted friend

CLAIM sentence:  Consumer magazine circulation has fallen, from around 

CLAIM sentence: ashx  ABC magazine circulation figures , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  A PPA survey in  found that magazine publishers in both the business to business and the consumer market were positive about the future % of consumer magazine publishers were profitable, with turnover in  projected to rise by over % and % of publishers expected profitability to remain steady or improve

CLAIM sentence:  Editorial practices and ethics of the magazine titles 

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard evidence from the editors of three of the most popular weekly magazine titles in Britain: Heat, OK! and Hello! Magazines

CLAIM sentence:  It has been evident that there are some similarities with newspapers in terms of practices of the magazine newsroom, awareness and application of the Editors Code of Practice, as well as the impact of technological change and the phenomenal growth of the internet as a source of news and information

CLAIM sentence:  These include three news desk reporters, one features editor and a number of reviews editors

CLAIM sentence:  Hello! Magazine has forty employees,  of whom are either journalists or subeditors

CLAIM sentence:  Northern and Shell owned OK! magazine is internationally one of best known and most read celebrity weekly magazines, and has a weekly UK circulation of ,, and an estimated readership of over m

CLAIM sentence:  The OK! Magazine website is managed and edited separately and has its own editor

CLAIM sentence:  Lisa Byrne, the current editor of OK! Magazine described her title as: basically an exclusive invitation into the rich and famous and celebrities in this country and the States with worldwide celebrities

CLAIM sentence:  So we invite our readers into peoples homes, to their babies christenings, first pictures of their children, amazing exclusive weddings, so -- even the parties are exclusive, so its just a fantastic aspirational magazine for readers to have a look at celebrities and their lifestyles

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Byrne told the Inquiry that the availability of news on the Internet has directly impacted the circulation celebrity magazines

CLAIM sentence:  She said that OK! Magazine now focuses less on celebrity news, and has shifted its emphasis on more exclusive features and stories which are less readily available online

CLAIM sentence:  The majority of content that is published in OK! Magazine is sourced either directly from celebrities or through their agents

CLAIM sentence:  The remainder of content is either bought-in interviews, celebrity features, news round-ups and celebrity columns

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Byrne said that she is aware of almost every story that goes in the magazine

CLAIM sentence:  The conduct of staff working at OK! Magazine is not subject to a specific code of practice

CLAIM sentence:  Nor does OK! Magazine subscribe to the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Byrne told the Inquiry that she expects her journalists to adhere to the terms of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  She argued that the efficacy of the reporting in OK! Magazine is dependent on a strict adherence to the Editors Code of Practice, as this is vital to maintaining the relationships that the title has built up with the celebrities on which they report

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Byrne also stressed the importance of ethics to the OK! Magazine newsroom, as well as her role in overseeing that ethical practices and standards are upheld on a day to day basis

CLAIM sentence:  Heat Magazine also operates a website, which has been described by current editor, Lucie Cave, as an important feature of the Heat brand

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Cave described the role of Heat Magazine: to cover the celebrities of the day in an entertaining fashion with an emphasis on interviews and amazing photo shoots that we do ourselves against a backdrop or a highly credible entertainment, TV and reviews section

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Cave fully expects all staff working for Heat Magazine to follow the Code and Practice and the Bauer guidelines as well as fully obeying the criminal and civil law

CLAIM sentence:  The magazine publishes some content that originates from PR material, although Ms Cave was not able to quantify exactly proportion of the magazine is derived from such material

CLAIM sentence:  Between January and June , Hello! Magazine recorded average total sales of , copies per week

CLAIM sentence:  Rosie Nixon, joint editor of Hello! Magazine described the title as promoting the positive portrayal of celebrity personalities

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Nixon said that the unwritten philosophy of Hello! Magazine lies in the phrase la spuma de la vida (the froth of life), words attributed to the founder of the company, Eduardo Perezs, grandfather

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Nixon has told the Inquiry that: the function of the magazine is to entertain

CLAIM sentence:  we take a look at the lighter sides of the personalities that we feature

CLAIM sentence:  Hello! Magazine publishes exclusive stories

CLAIM sentence:  Additionally, the magazine also publishes some news-based stories obtained through a variety of PR agencies

CLAIM sentence:  She argued that as a weekly publication, Hello! Magazine is primarily focused on building long-term relationships with personalities, rather than getting one-off scoops

CLAIM sentence:  Journalists at Hello! Magazine are expected to abide by the PCC Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Nixon told the Inquiry that there are no formal internal documents relating to corporate of editorial governance beyond the PCC Code

CLAIM sentence:  The majority of the magazines content is produced in-house by pay-roll staff; a smaller amount of material is generated by freelance journalists, whose work is invoiced and processed according to the companys procurement policies

CLAIM sentence:  Hello! Magazine makes payments for exclusive stories, and any fees are discussed and agreed with HOLA, S

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the Guidelines, the BBC must also comply with sections of Ofcoms statutory Broadcasting Code, including the Code on fairness and privacy

CLAIM sentence:  This safeguards the treatment of individuals and organisations in programmes broadcasted by the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  Compliance with the BBCs Editorial Guidelines is the responsibility of the individual editor and producer

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC has separate policies relating to complaints, data protection, and fraud management and ant-bribery

CLAIM sentence:  Different units at the BBC have responsibility for the general oversight of specific regulatory areas

CLAIM sentence:  For example, Fraud Management is overseen by the Investigations Unit under the overall supervision of the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer

CLAIM sentence:  With effect from  October , the Controller, Fair Trading was appointed as BBC Compliance Officer

CLAIM sentence:   Editorial policy compliance and financial compliance fall outside the remit of the Compliance Units functions

CLAIM sentence:  The Trust has a supervisory role which is generally restricted to the regulation of broadcast content after it has been transmitted

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Patten told the Inquiry that: I would never ever seek to interfere with one of [Mr Thompsons] editorial decisions

CLAIM sentence:  I wouldnt, for example, ever ask to see a BBC programme, at least not in conceivable circumstances, before it was broadcast, if the Director General had decided it was worth broadcasting

CLAIM sentence:  However, Lord Patten also told us that there were occasions where the Trust would consider the principles of the Editorial Guidelines prior to transmission

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom is responsible for the regulation of some aspects of the content produced by the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  This responsibility is defined in the Royal Charter and Framework Agreement, and the Communications Act 

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom exercises a regulatory function in relation to the BBCs commercial activities, notably where they impact on the wider media market

CLAIM sentence:  All BBC commercial services must comply with the Ofcom Statutory Code, and Article  of the Framework Agreement requires the BBC Trust and Ofcom to create a Joint Steering Group in respect of market impact assessments

CLAIM sentence:  This is accompanied by an express recognition that Ofcom could play a greater role and offer assistance and expertise to the BBC, including in relation to areas which currently fall within the remit of the BBC Trust (such as non services)

CLAIM sentence:  Where Ofcom finds a breach of the privacy or fairness sections of its Code, it may require the BBC to broadcast a statement of its findings

CLAIM sentence:  Further, should Ofcom find that the Code has been breached seriously, deliberately, repeatedly, or recklessly, it can impose sanctions which range from a requirement to broadcast a correction or statement of finding to a fine of up to ,

CLAIM sentence:  Guidance on right to reply expressly refers to the requirement under the Ofcom Broadcasting Code to afford the person a timely opportunity to respond

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard evidence of situations where editorial incidents have taken place, which have led the BBC Trust to commission independent investigations into apparent breaches of the Editorial Guidelines, and the decision to impose relevant sanctions

CLAIM sentence:  The scandal around the misuse of premium rate phone lines by the BBC in , in which it was revealed that viewers had been invited to call premium rate numbers in order to enter competitions on programmes that had, in fact, been pre-recorded, is an example

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC Executive proposed an action plan and the BBC Trust commissioned an independent report by Ronald Neil

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Neil was appointed an independent editorial adviser to the Trust in order to review the Executives action plan

CLAIM sentence:  This resulted in the development of new training programmes, including the BBC  p, para ; p, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In the interim, audience phone-ins were suspended and a new Interactive Advice and Compliance Unit was created to look at audience interaction with the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  In December , BBC Management announced an action plan to address the editorial failings which had led to the programme being broadcast

CLAIM sentence:  The progress made under this action plan was then subject to an independent review carried out by Tony Stoller (former Chief Executive of the Radio Authority) and Tim Suter (former broadcasting partner and Board member at Ofcom) for the BBC Trust

CLAIM sentence:  Both the BBC Executive and the BBC Trust reported on the findings of that independent review

CLAIM sentence:  Speaking to the importance to the BBC of addressing these failings in editorial conduct, Mr Thompson told the Inquiry about his role in informing the public of the necessary controls that have since been implemented, that:  its fundamental to my duty in this role

CLAIM sentence:  The recent revelations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile, and decisions around the Newsnight investigation into the matter, have raised questions in some quarters as to the effectiveness of broadcasting regulation and the internal governance systems within the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  I merely note that, without in any way prejudging any of those investigations, the original Newsnight investigations, the ITV documentary that ultimately revealed the allegations, and the subsequent Panorama programme that investigated the handling of the matter within the BBC, were produced within the constraints of broadcasting regulation, not by the print press

CLAIM sentence:  Any attempt, therefore, to suggest that broadcasting regulation has had any part in constraining reporting on the matter is simply not borne out by the facts

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC is required to comply with the Royal Charter and the Framework Agreement

CLAIM sentence:  Complaints to the BBC therefore have an important role to play: The BBCs complaints handling framework (including appeals to the Trust) is intended to provide appropriate, proportionate and cost effective methods of securing that that BBC complies with its obligations and that remedies are provided which are proportionate and related to any alleged non-compliance

CLAIM sentence:  A Trust Protocol is established by the Trust, which oversees the procedures for specific areas of complaint, including editorial complaints

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard, the responsibility as final arbiter is delegated to the Editorial Standards Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Any BBC viewer who is dissatisfied with any of the content broadcasted by the BBC may submit their complaint directly to the Corporation

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Patten told the Inquiry that, in practice, Ofcom would inform the complainant that such a complaint could be dealt with by the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  Equally, the Editorial Standards Committee is unlikely to consider a fairness and privacy or standards matter which overlaps with the regulatory responsibilities of Ofcom, until Ofcom has completed its own processes

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Patten explained the nature of the complaints system, whereby viewer complaints are dealt with at the first stage by the executives information department (possibly including the producers of the programme in question itself)

CLAIM sentence:  Should no resolution result from this first stage of mediation, viewers can take complaints to a second stage process where they are handled by the complaints unit, governed by the Complaints Management Board (which reports directly to the BBC Direction Group)

CLAIM sentence:  The last stage is the process of appeal to the Trust, should the complaint be unresolved to the satisfaction of the viewer

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Pattens review of BBC Governance expressly acknowledged licence fee payers had expressed concerns that the current system was too complicated and too slow

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that he has recommended the appointment of a chief of editorial complaints, of corrections, whose role would be to ensure that the system was improved and operated in a transparent manner

CLAIM sentence:  The Governance Report concluded that the BBC should publish a single page guide explaining where complainants should go to complain about BBC broadcast content or services

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Patten told the Inquiry that the BBC will work with Ofcom to ensure there is common language in the guide to explain in what circumstances complainants may complain to Ofcom

CLAIM sentence:  In , the BBC Editorial Standards Committee recorded that % of complaints had been dealt with within ten working days

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard, Mr Thompson informed the Inquiry that: The BBC receives well over a million contacts from the public every year, of which only a relatively small proportion are complaints, but that still adds up to something like , complaints a year, of which the overwhelming majority are responded to very quickly

CLAIM sentence:  ITN ITN is a news provider responsible for the production of the news programme for the broadcast channel, ITV

CLAIM sentence:  ITN also produce Channel  News, through a contractual agreement between ITN and Channel 

CLAIM sentence:  The Chair of ITN, Maggie Carver, is responsible for the organisation, but delegates editorial matters to the Chief Executive Officer, John Hardie, who is responsible for the management of editors of both ITV News and Channel  News

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Carver is responsible for ensuring that the corporate governance set out by the company is adhered to by staff

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Battle is author of the Compliance Manual, first published in July 

CLAIM sentence:  The Compliance Manual sets out the industry regulations that affect news reporting, the main areas of laws affecting journalism such as libel, copyright, privacy and contempt of court and internal ITN standards and procedures

CLAIM sentence:  Although Jim Gray, Editor of Channel  News, told the Inquiry that the review of the Compliance Manual was regular procedure, he explained that additionally as part of the process triggered by this Inquiry, we have held an independent external Inquiry into ITNs journalistic practices and some the [sic] findings of that will feature in the new Compliance Manual

CLAIM sentence:   Mr Battle also gave evidence to this effect, stating that:  pp-, lines -, Mark Thompson, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray is responsible for the entirety of editorial content of Channel  News, and for upholding relevant policies to ensure that journalists and individual editors at Channel  News are required to comply with the ITN Compliance Manual

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray reports directly to Mr Hardie, ITNs Chief Executive Officer

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray told the Inquiry that Channel  News applied similar principles to the Omand principles, which are a whole series of tests about the proportionality of what is being proposed matches the level of gravity of what the story may be

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray describes Channel  News as a public service news broadcaster with an editorial focus on news that is in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  He also told the Inquiry that there is a culture at Channel  News of behaving ethically and acceptance of journalists being held to account for their reporting

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray said in this regard that: We dont want to cause any problems, and we certainly dont want so [sic] have any incoming attack on our reputation or integrity which would then go forward to possibly damage Channel s repute, which we are contractually obliged to uphold and we must uphold and we want to

CLAIM sentence:  Corporate governance at ITN and Channel  News 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Battle explained that although ITN is not a content broadcaster, the organisation is still obliged to operate in accordance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, as well as with the expectations and requirements of the individual broadcasters, ITV or Channel 

CLAIM sentence:  There are three levels of compliance within Channel  News: the ITN system and core Compliance Manual; the Channel  independent producers handbook; and contractual obligations between ITN and Channel  which require consultation and notice in certain circumstances

CLAIM sentence:  Separately, under the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, Channel  News is obliged to offer timely and appropriate rights of  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  p, lines -, Jim Gray, ibid  Chapter  | Alternative News Providers C\xcreply to the subject of a story

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray also described how Channel  News would approach a story that might involve potential breach of privacy: if it was a serious allegation of wrongdoing or criminality, we would normally expect to contact the subject of the story in writing, putting forward the claims and the allegations and the evidence we had for what was going to be proposed to be contained in the report, and then give sufficient amount of time for the subject to respond

CLAIM sentence:  That can vary, Thats not set down but it could be a matter of days or it could be longer

CLAIM sentence:  In some cases, depending on the response from the subject, it can drag on

CLAIM sentence:  Commenting on the role of Ofcom in relation to Channel , and Channel  News, Mr Gray told the Inquiry that the Ofcom Broadcasting Code helps to codify the principles and cultural standards that Channel  News seeks to uphold

CLAIM sentence:  He explained this thus: through the ITN guidelines, [we] turn [the Code] into practice, and thats helpful as well, because for the team at ITN, that makes it our guidelines

CLAIM sentence:  Its not an external imposition

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to complaints handling, Mr Battle told the Inquiry that ITN does not receive many complaints through Ofcom

CLAIM sentence:  Complaints in relation to Channel  News are handled by Mr Grays Deputy Editor at Channel  News, who consults closely with the production team

CLAIM sentence:  The complaints are assessed in relation to the report in question with the Head of Compliance, documented as appropriate in consultation with Channel 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray explained that only in serious cases would a complaint be referred to him

CLAIM sentence:  However, should a complaint be submitted through Ofcom, then the complaint would be handled in accordance with the terms set down by the regulator

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Gray explained that Channel  News had received remarkably few complaints and, specifically, over the course of five years, we havent actually had a finding against us from an Ofcom complaint except once and that was a partial ruling against us on an investigation

CLAIM sentence:  The media landscape, particularly the provision of news, both globally and in the UK has been transformed by the invention and phenomenal development of the Internet

CLAIM sentence:  % of all the time that adults spend engaging with media is spent on the internet, with this figure rising to % for those aged between  and 

CLAIM sentence:  All UK media organisations, whether newspapers, broadcasters or others now have an internet presence

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the individual websites of the worlds news providers there are news aggregation services

CLAIM sentence:  These sites tend to rely on automatic selection through algorithms and usually involve no active editorial involvement by the aggregator

CLAIM sentence:  In some circumstances this will involve simply directing the user to the website of the news provider

CLAIM sentence:  In others, it involves essentially importing the news report from the original provider to the site of the aggregator

CLAIM sentence:  In the latter case this will mean that any associated advertising revenues will go to the aggregator rather than to the news provider

CLAIM sentence:  These sites are characterised by the fact that those operating the sites have little or no editorial input to the content of the material that they provide to users, take no responsibility for the accuracy of articles to which their users are directed, and have no role in the newsgathering process

CLAIM sentence:  Although some news sites are merely aggregators of news, linking to content hosted by other news websites, Google news is different

CLAIM sentence:  It is a function within Google that will search for material only through online news content

CLAIM sentence:  However, the content itself is not generated by Google, nor does Google operate any editorial control over the searched content beyond the algorithms that facilitate the search

CLAIM sentence:  Blogs and other commentary come in a number of different forms, but are essentially a personal commentary

CLAIM sentence:  They can include examples of citizen journalism produced by individuals sharing their experience of, and views on, events that occur

CLAIM sentence:  The Sun has argued that the ready availability of photographs of Prince Harry on the Internet justified in part its decision to publish those same photographs

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, in many ways this loose and lightly regulated structure has been encouraged by governments and by users as a source of both innovation and growth

CLAIM sentence:  The transmission of content wirelessly through the national radio spectrum network is regulated through the Wireless Telegraphy Act  and has regulatory impacts for access to the Internet through wireless devices other than computers such as mobiles phones (especially smart phones like the iPhone), and other Internet enabled devices such as tablets (like the iPad and Kindles)

CLAIM sentence:  Broadcast content, known as video on demand when it is made available online, through for example the BBC iPlayer service, or in the case of Channel , through oD, is regulated by the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations  and the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations , by the Authority for Television on Demand (ATVOD)

CLAIM sentence:  These ensure that protections similar to those applied to broadcast content are applied to that same or similar content when made available online

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to regulation of broadcast and equivalent content through ATVOD, UK Internet Service Providers have also taken a broadly self-regulatory approach to some of the content they host and have applied a limited number of standards to that content

CLAIM sentence:  The IWF works closely with ISPs to ensure that webpages, including those hosted outside of the UK, which provide access to potentially criminal content and, specifically, images of child abuse, are reported and removed or blocked at source

CLAIM sentence:  To this end, it is worth noting that Twitter and other social media have cooperated with UK law enforcement in cases of obvious criminality

CLAIM sentence:  During the rioting in the summer of , both RIM Blackberry and Twitter worked closely with police and other enforcement agencies to identify those using social media and communications networks to perpetrate or help commit criminal acts

CLAIM sentence:  These changes have extended the enforcement powers available to the ICO under the DPA into the Privacy and the Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), and include powers to: levy civil monetary penalties for PECR offences; compel Communication Providers to disclose the identity of third parties; and amend Assessment Notice powers which will enable the ICO to compel organisations to submit to an e-privacy audit

CLAIM sentence:  The changes have been made in response to concerns at a number of high-profile data breaches, some as a consequence of criminal hacking, others by the apparent unwillingness of service providers to pay full heed of data protection legislation (as in the case of the unintentional interception of data from wifi-wireless and remote internet devices by Google in )

CLAIM sentence:  This has been alluded to in evidence given to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Google stated that privacy online was a matter of growing importance to the company

CLAIM sentence:  David John Collins, Vice President of Global Communications and Public affairs for Google, explained that the companys attitude  Speech by the Rt Hon Ed Vaizey, Minister of State for Culture, Communications and the Creative Industries, to PICTOR, th October   pp-, (DCMS), HMG response to its consultation on proposals and overall approach including its consultation on specific issues (), http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Alternative News Providers C\xctowards privacy online and related matters has changed considerably with time reflecting both the growth in the use of online services and the changing legal landscape with regard to the internet

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Collins said: Google has always taken privacy seriously from a very strict compliance position; its taken privacy seriously because ultimately the trust that we have with our users is incredibly important

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry heard evidence in regard to the operation of blogs, online news aggregators, publishers, social network sites and online hosts

CLAIM sentence:  There are a number of news blogs the Huffington Post is an early, high profile example of one, which has developed over the years into something much more like an online newspaper which specifically aim to bring a range of news stories and views on those stories to their readers

CLAIM sentence:  Other examples include the Guido Fawkes Blog, which focuses on tittle-tattle, gossip and rumours about Parliament; the Jack of Kent Blog, which describes itself as liberal and critical; and Popbitch, which is a celebrity newsletter and message-board

CLAIM sentence:  Paul Staines, the founder of the Guido Fawkes website, stated that Guido Fawkes actively seeks to break stories and prides itself on doing so ahead of the main news providers

CLAIM sentence:  For example, Mr Staines told the Inquiry that the Guido Fawkes site generally had between , and , readers daily

CLAIM sentence:  However, when very big stories are being broken this can rise to as many as , visitors per hour

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright explained the nature and purpose of Popbitch as a gossip site

CLAIM sentence:  Understandably perhaps, for a relatively small operation, the standards of proof deployed by Ms Wright are lower, and the processes different from those that might be found on a print newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines said:  I particularly dont think people in public life, people who are, you know, paid for by the taxpayers, or subject to the voters, should expect the same degree of privacy as a private citizen who has no public life can expect

CLAIM sentence:  These people their character speaks to what the voters need to know about them as politicians, so if they misbehave in their private life its quite common that somebody who will lie to their wife will lie to the voters

CLAIM sentence:  Thats an old adage that has some truth to it

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, Mr Staines stated in evidence that he would publish information that he assessed to be in public interest even if that information was the subject of a legally enforceable injunction

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines also gave evidence on the standards and editorial processes he deploys with regard to the content he publishes

CLAIM sentence:  He said that in many cases he is unable to corroborate stories through a second source: Yeah, quite often theres only one source in the room who can provide us with information, so we have no choice

CLAIM sentence:  We dont rely on single sourcing from people we dont know

CLAIM sentence:  There has to be some authority to that person or we have to have a level of trust built up over time

CLAIM sentence:  If someone came in fresh and was a single source we couldnt verify in any way whatsoever, Id be very reluctant to run with it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines also made clear that accuracy was as important to the credibility of a blog site like Guido Fawkes as it was for a print newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  It is for this reason that the majority of material sourced by Mr Staines was either verifiable or from a trusted source

CLAIM sentence:  Only some % of material might be from an unknown source

CLAIM sentence:  Additionally, Mr Staines told the Inquiry that journalists occasionally provided him with material that an editor may have decided not to publish (that had been spiked), or that might not fit with the overall agenda of the publication in question

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines also stated, in a parallel that he himself has drawn with the former editor of The Sun, Kelvin Mackenzie, that he would run stories that are single sourced if the story was of little consequence, or in keeping with the overall tone of the Guido Fawkes site, namely, that it was gossipy or humorous in nature

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Buzasi gave evidence on the importance of trust to the Huffington Post UK, and particularly to its reputation as a news source

CLAIM sentence:  This has informed editorial and management decisions made around training and editorial guidelines

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore expected that all stories are verifiable and are not single sourced

CLAIM sentence:  A similar emphasis on trust is placed on those news sites that the Huffington Post UK will link to

CLAIM sentence:  It is the only solely online news provider to have elected to this and did so in September 

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, Ms Wright told the Inquiry that although she was aware of the PCC Code she saw no reason for Popbitch to be part of the system of self-regulation through the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The service hosts blogging sites, and now hosts more than  trillion words

CLAIM sentence:  That total increases at rate of over , words every minute

CLAIM sentence:  Beyond this, Google does not exercise any editorial control over the content it hosts on its blogger service

CLAIM sentence:  It does, however, provide a notice and take down service

CLAIM sentence:  Googles legal Director, Daphne Keller, has said that while a blogger service is available only through the 

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART C | The PressC\xcthat content originating from a given jurisdiction is compliant with local law, if it receives a complaint about the content in question

CLAIM sentence:  A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on the building and reflecting of social networks or social relations among people who, for example, share interests and/or activities

CLAIM sentence:  A social network service essentially consists of a representation of each user (often a profile), his/her social links, and a variety of additional services

CLAIM sentence:  Although there is limited news provision in the terms that are relevant to this Inquiry on pure social networking sites, all social networks provide opportunities for individuals to disseminate and discuss news, information and comment

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, everyday use of the Internet is increasingly characterised by the use of social networking sites and other social media

CLAIM sentence:  Their growth has been little short of phenomenal

CLAIM sentence:  The television personality and actor, Stephen Fry, one of the most prolific celebrity tweeters has over  million Twitter followers

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, there are clear and very recent examples of this practice that do not need to be repeated here

CLAIM sentence:  However, Twitter has told the Inquiry that its rules forbid members from using the service for any unlawful purpose, and any material that is found by the company to contravene that policy can be taken down or removed

CLAIM sentence:  In this respect Twitter is similar to other social media

CLAIM sentence:  Most recent trends in social network technology have been towards the concept of real- time web and location based services

CLAIM sentence:  The real time web service allows users to generate content, that is broadcast as it is being uploaded the concept is potentially analogous to and may indeed come to challenge live radio and television broadcasts as well as traditional print media

CLAIM sentence:  However, as witnesses to the Inquiry representing Internet firms have sought to make clear, where services are targeted at a given jurisdiction, they will also seek to comply with local law

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Wright was keen to emphasise, echoing points made by other witnesses representing online publishers and Internet businesses, that Popbitch sought to obey the local law in each of the jurisdictions in which it operated

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines provided different and interesting evidence in relation to legal accountability and enforcement, particularly in relation to legal jurisdictions, that illustrates well the problems in respect of the application of national law by online publishers

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines was candid about this

CLAIM sentence:  The site was previously hosted by Google on the Google free blogger system but, as Mr Staines explained, was moved when Google became more willing to give in to legal threats

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines said by way of further explanation: I thought it be a good moment to switch from them to a hosting provider who was robust and would stand up for my First Amendment protections

CLAIM sentence:  This switch from Google to another blog host was made in order to make it more difficult for content Mr Staines had published to be challenged through the UK courts; he cited the experience of Wikileaks as a sufficient justification for this course of action

CLAIM sentence:  Further, Mr Staines stated that although he had been threatened with legal action on a number of occasions, no such action had been successfully prosecuted

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines also made clear that he has ignored UK Court decisions without adverse consequences

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines said that he uploaded the memo in question onto a number of overseas servers to circumvent injunctions issued by the law firm Carter Ruck

CLAIM sentence:  The attitude of Mr Staines revealed in evidence with regard to compliance with national law was unique among witnesses from online businesses who have given evidence to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crowell made clear that it would be both technologically and physically impossible for Twitter to pre-moderate the user-generated content hosted by Twitter, in this case tweets, and adjudicate on their potential illegality

CLAIM sentence:  Articulating the position of Google with regard to compliance in this area, Ms Keller explained that given the volume of material generated by third parties that Google either indexes, searches or hosts depending on the relevant Google service or function, it is impossible for Google to pre-moderate that content in any way or, to make adjudications as to whether content is legal or not

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Crowell was keen to stress that recent technological changes since the start of  have enabled Twitter to withhold tweets within a given jurisdiction

CLAIM sentence:  This will enable Twitter to comply more effectively with differences in local law in different jurisdictions

CLAIM sentence:  He said that Google services targeted at a particular country comply with local law and that this applies as much to privacy and other related matters as it does to other areas of law

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example, Mr Collins explained that Google policy on privacy in the UK was shaped through an ongoing dialogue with the ICO, which had provided relevant advice

CLAIM sentence: uk domain name underpinned the provision of services to the UK as well as compliance with the local law

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Keller explained that webmasters (those who author and maintain websites) are able to request that their site is not indexed and will therefore not appear in searches

CLAIM sentence:  Internet Service Providers offering services to UK customers will block content that has been declared illegal

CLAIM sentence:  Most successful attempts to induce service providers of any sort to take enforcement action in relation to content are either through agreement, or dependant on case-specific court orders

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Crowell (as well as representatives from Microsoft and Google) said that Twitter would enforce orders made by UK courts, in so far as they might  p, lines -, David John Collins, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Ms Keller has also made clear that, in cases of alleged defamation, it is Google policy in most cases only to remove material from a given service if the complainant was able to provide a legal judgment in support of their claim

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Collins of Google described the apportionment of responsibilities between publishers and host thus: Firstly, there is a very clear set of regulations which apply to technical intermediaries hosting platforms

CLAIM sentence:  I know that youre very aware of it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Staines also described with some colour the difficulties that an individual or company might encounter in trying to have content removed from the internet:  p, lines -, Colin Crowell, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART C | The PressC\xcI think it is impossible for them to do anything, I would basically upload it to a free hosting service after the close of business hours, so if the law firm was contacting Yahoo India, they would find that there would be no one at home and it would be up on that website until the next day at the very least

CLAIM sentence:  Press photographers are another source of news material

CLAIM sentence:  Those photographers who are directly employed, whether by newspapers or by agencies, might expect to be subject to the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, the Inquiry has been told by witnesses both from picture agencies and newspapers that the expectation is that press photographers would abide by the terms of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Since then, UK newspaper editors have been committed by the Editors Code of Practice not to publish images that are taken in contravention of the Code

CLAIM sentence:  The responsibility for checking whether the Code of Practice has been breached in relation to any specific image sits with the newspaper concerned

CLAIM sentence:  The market for celebrity and news photographs is now a global one

CLAIM sentence:  Recent cases involving Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge are instructive and are described elsewhere in this Report

CLAIM sentence:  I mean, actually, the Daily Mail is an incredibly sort of powerful voice in the nation's politics because it's a very strong product, it puts its voice very powerfully, and that's not related really to its market power, it's [related] to the way it pushes its agenda

CLAIM sentence:  There is a generally held view that the media is of central importance for a healthy, well- informed democracy and therefore control of the media should not be concentrated in too few hands

CLAIM sentence:  This is based on a concern that a small number of media owners could have too much influence in terms of content and, in particular, agenda setting

CLAIM sentence:  Policy and legislation have been designed overall to achieve a range of different media voices, which enable consumers to have access to a range of views, which helps them to actively participate in the democratic process in the widest sense

CLAIM sentence:  The first is the need for a sufficient plurality of views in newspapers in each market for newspapers and the second is the need for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving [every] audience [in the UK]

CLAIM sentence:  The difference between a plurality of views and the plurality of persons with control of media enterprises is clear

CLAIM sentence:  The rationale as to why the first should apply in relation to newspapers and the second in relation to media enterprises is less clear

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, the media market has moved on considerably since the Communications Act  was passed and the nature and number of media enterprises serving markets in the UK has changed

CLAIM sentence:  Witnesses to the Inquiry took various approaches to what they understood by the need for plurality in the media

CLAIM sentence:  Robin Foster, an independent adviser on regulatory policy and strategic issues in the communications sector, described two aspects of plurality that he considered important: to make sure that there was a reasonable wide range and diversity of news and opinion available to the public, and to make sure that no single one of those news providers became so powerful that they had too much of an influence on opinion-forming and the political agenda

CLAIM sentence:  Professor Steven Barnett, University of Westminster, said that plurality must encompass both a sufficient number of competing media enterprises and (separately) the prevention of an unhealthy accretion of power by any single enterprise

CLAIM sentence:  The rationale for requiring plurality within the media and the different dimensions of it that are important seem uncontroversial

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom notes that both they and other regulatory authorities have concentrated to date on news and current affairs, but that this is not required by the legislative framework

CLAIM sentence:  First, where broadcast media are concerned, it can be argued that the existing rules around accuracy and impartiality should counter concerns about concentration of ownership

CLAIM sentence:  Second, there have been specific rules constraining the ability of any one person or company to own too large a proportion of the broadcast market, and restrictions on the extent to which any one person or company can own both a national newspaper and a national terrestrial television channel or a local newspaper and a local television channel

CLAIM sentence:  The process by which that position changed and how the current provision in the  Act relating to media mergers was introduced is fully documented later in the Report

CLAIM sentence:  The media ownership regime takes as its starting point the position that a variety of owners will represent a variety of different viewpoints

CLAIM sentence:  Media ownership rules act as a constraint on the normal workings of the market, so successive Governments have thought it important to strike an appropriate balance between the needs of plurality and the needs of the wider economy, and to ensure that media ownership rules are no more burdensome than necessary

CLAIM sentence:  the history of media ownership rules in the uK from the s 

CLAIM sentence:  Legislative background DCMS has very helpfully provided a detailed history of the Media Ownership Rules in the UK from the s to the most recent developments; this can be viewed as part of the evidence submitted to this Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The constitutional framework for UK commercial terrestrial television and local radio sectors during the s was provided by the Broadcasting Act  and consolidated in the Broadcasting Act 

CLAIM sentence:  The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) had the function of providing television and radio services additional to those of the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  It therefore acted as both broadcaster and regulator

CLAIM sentence:  It did this by entering into contractual arrangements with ITV and Independent Local Radio franchisees, whereby the contractors agreed to supply programmes for their regions and the IBA agreed to transmit them

CLAIM sentence:  The issue of ownership restrictions did not therefore arise as providers of commercial TV and radio services were not owners of licences but contractors to the IBA

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  made significant changes to this regime by abolishing the IBA and establishing the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority instead

CLAIM sentence:  The main effects of the Act were as follows: (a) (b) (c) The previous contract-based regulatory system was replaced by a licensing system, with each licence subject to certain conditions and penalties for non-compliance; Licences for certain services were to be awarded by the ITC and RA through competitive tender to the highest bidder after a quality threshold and sustainability test had been passed, except in exceptional circumstances; Cable and satellite programme licences were to be issued on compliance with the ITC codes consumer protection requirements; (d) Channel  was to be provided by a new non-profit making body, the Channel Four Corporation, under licence from the ITC; and (e) Provision was made for the licensing of a new terrestrial television service, Channel  (which came to air in )

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  introduced ownership restrictions that licences could be held and traded

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  imposed a limit of one licence where the  ibid  lTC Notes, The Broadcasting Acts of  and , June   pp-, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  licence-holders total audience share was over %, and provided that a national licence could only be held for either Channel  or Channel 

CLAIM sentence:  The Communications Act  repealed the two rules which prevented the joint ownership of National Channel  and Channel , and removed stand-alone accumulation limits for all television licences

CLAIM sentence:  ITV plc (which resulted from the merger of Carlton and Granada in ) now holds all but three of the  Regional Channel  licences (those being UTV and Northern and Central Scotland)

CLAIM sentence:  Provision of broadcast news Specific controls were introduced to ensure plurality of the provision of broadcast news

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  allowed for the ITC to nominate news providers who would be eligible to provide news programmes for holders of Regional Channel  licences (nominated news providers)

CLAIM sentence:  It was only possible to hold % of one nominated news provider, and each nominated news provider was only permitted to own up to % of a Regional Channel  licence (ie % of any company holding a Regional Channel  licence)

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  then made further provision for all holders of Regional Channel  licences to, as far as possible, appoint the same (single) news provider (the appointed news provider)

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of this provision was to ensure that high quality national and international news was carried across all Channel  regions at peak times by a single news provider

CLAIM sentence:  This was needed because Channel , unlike the BBC, was not a single network, but made up of a number of Channel  regions under different ownership

CLAIM sentence:  By requiring all Regional Channel  licence holders to select the same nominated news provider, from providers nominated for that purpose by the ITC, the rules guaranteed a nationwide competitor to the BBCs news services

CLAIM sentence:  Eventually the Communications Act  lifted all restrictions on the ownership of nominated news providers, while retaining the requirement for all Regional Channel  licence-holders to appoint the same nominated news provider

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  introduced the licensing regime for digital TV and, at the same time, introduced certain ownership limits in relation to the number of digital licences that could be held

CLAIM sentence:  These rules were removed by the Communications Act , consistent with its overall deregulatory approach, so there are now no explicit ownership rules in respect of digital TV services

CLAIM sentence:   p, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  placed no restrictions on cable and satellite licences

CLAIM sentence:  The Act did place requirements on original programming in respect of direct satellite services (DBS) holding UK licenses for broadcasting on UK frequencies

CLAIM sentence:  No such requirement was placed on the holders of other satellite licenses (non-DBS)

CLAIM sentence:  In practice, this meant that British Satellite Broadcasting was subject to this requirement, whilst Sky was not, giving a commercial advantage at the time to Sky in a market that proved not to be sufficient to support two satellite broadcasters

CLAIM sentence:  National newspapers could not hold more than a % stake in a DBS broadcasting satellite channel

CLAIM sentence:  However, no such restriction was placed on newspapers owning non-DBS licences

CLAIM sentence:  The Government of the day explained that this was because the number of DBS licences was restricted by international agreement to five, whereas the number of non-DBS licences was not restricted and was likely to grow significantly

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  placed an upper limit on ownership of  analogue local radio licences

CLAIM sentence:  The Communications Act  introduced a new system that would ensure at least three local owners in any area in addition to the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  This was subsequently changed to secure at least two, rather than three, local owners in addition to the BBC

CLAIM sentence:  Where there were only one or two local radio stations in an area all ownership restrictions were removed (subject to the local cross media ownership rule designed to ensure that there were not total local monopolies)

CLAIM sentence:  Following a report from Ofcom in , all local radio ownership rules were repealed by the Media Ownership (Radio and Cross Media) Order 

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  placed restrictions on one person holding more than one of the three national analogue commercial radio licences

CLAIM sentence:  This rule was removed in the Communications Act 

CLAIM sentence:  Under the Broadcasting Act , a person was limited to one digital service licence or % of the total audience points (whichever was the higher) and was also disqualified from providing more than one non-simulcast local digital sound programme service on a single multiplex, unless there was another multiplex operating in the same geographical area

CLAIM sentence:  Following the Communications Act , these rules were replaced by a new local points based regime; this mirrored the provisions of the analogue regime by placing a limit on digital radio licences of % of the points available in an area

CLAIM sentence:  There are restrictions on the holding of broadcasting licences by certain types or classes of owners

CLAIM sentence:  Historically there have been prohibitions on religious bodies holding broadcasting licenses

CLAIM sentence:  Over recent decades those restrictions have been significantly reduced, although religious bodies still cannot hold licences for Channel , Channel  or any national analogue radio licence

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  prevented local authorities from holding broadcasting licences

CLAIM sentence:  The Communications Act  now allows local authorities to hold broadcast licences for information purposes, and puts in place safeguards to prevent this from being exploited for political purposes

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  also prevented political parties from holding broadcasting licences (as there were concerns that they could not run a broadcasting company with sufficient impartiality)

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  additionally prevented advertising agencies from holding broadcasting licences and this restriction has continued

CLAIM sentence:  The Broadcasting Act  also introduced some foreign ownership restrictions to non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries (it was not permitted to place restrictions on EEA companies and individuals), which were expanded upon by the Broadcasting Act 

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, in circumstances fully described later in the Report, the Communications Act  did remove the restrictions and there is now no restriction on foreign ownership of any broadcasting licence, subject, of course, to other ownership restrictions

CLAIM sentence:  The position under the Broadcasting Act  was: (a) National newspaper owners were tightly limited in their holdings in terrestrial TV and radio, and in domestic satellite broadcasters

CLAIM sentence:  Within each category they could hold up to % of one licence, and then up to % of any others

CLAIM sentence:  They were allowed full control of non-domestic satellite broadcasters in order to encourage investment in an uncertain and high-risk enterprise

CLAIM sentence:  (By  there were no domestic satellite broadcasters and the largest non-domestic satellite broadcaster was BSkyB); Local newspaper owners were less tightly controlled, in being allowed to own regional TV or local radio broadcasters, provided there was no significant overlap between the licence area and the papers circulation area; (b) (c) National TV and radio (and regional Channel ) broadcasters were limited to a % (d) stake in national newspapers and non-domestic satellite licences; and There were no cross-media restrictions on ownership cable services (other than that satellite providers could not own more than % of a terrestrial TV or National Radio licence)

CLAIM sentence:  The Communications Act  revised these rules: (a) Retention of the national rule concerning cross-media ownership between newspapers and ITV

CLAIM sentence:  This was expressed as follows: (i) no one controlling more than % of the national newspaper market may hold any licence for Channel ; no one controlling more than % of the national newspaper market may hold more than a % stake in any Channel  service; and (ii) (iii) a company may not own more than a % share in such a service if more than % of its stock is in turn owned by a national newspaper proprietor with more than % of the market

CLAIM sentence:  (b) Retention of a parallel local rule: no one owning a regional Channel  licence may own (c) more than % of the local/regional newspaper market in the same region; Stricter application of the local radio ownership rules where potential owners had other media interests

CLAIM sentence:  The effect was to ensure that, in these cases, there would be a minimum of three media owners in each area across TV, newspapers and radio; (d) A local cross-media rule (the local monopolies rule) designed to ensure that there were no complete monopolies in areas with only one or two local radio stations; All other cross-media ownership rules were repealed

CLAIM sentence:  The Communications Act  requires Ofcom to review all media ownership rules at least every three years

CLAIM sentence:  In its second report in November , Ofcom concluded that that national / rule should be retained and that the local cross media ownership rules should be liberalised so that the only restriction remaining would be on ownership of all three of: local newspapers (with % plus local market share); a local radio station; and a regional Channel  licence

CLAIM sentence:  According to Ofcom: this liberalisation will increase the flexibility of local media to respond to market pressures

CLAIM sentence:  Consumers still rely on television, radio and press for news, so going further to complete removal of the rules could reduce protections for plurality

CLAIM sentence:  On  July , the Secretary of State asked Ofcom to revisit its advice on retaining the local monopolies rule

CLAIM sentence:  It recognised that there had been some changes in circumstances since the original report but that a decision on whether to remove this one remaining local rule is a matter of judgement and one which is rightly made by Government and Parliament

CLAIM sentence: uk/consultations/morr/statement/  pp-, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/binaries/consultations/morr/response-localmedia/ Local Media Final Document

CLAIM sentence:  The Governments view was that local media ownership rules (for television, radio and newspapers) placed unnecessary limitations on ownership within commercial media; that the rules were no longer appropriate in a converging digital world; and that removing regulatory barriers would help established industries adapt to new environments

CLAIM sentence:  The deregulation of the local media ownership regulations now enables partnerships between local newspapers, radio and Channel  television stations to promote a strong and diverse local media industry

CLAIM sentence:  In applying the test the Secretary of State takes into account the need for: (a) (b) (c) a sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises serving any audience; a wide range of high quality broadcasting that appeals to different tastes and interests; and a genuine commitment to Ofcoms standards code

CLAIM sentence:  Partly due to Iobbying from industry, Ministers indicated that they were not minded to exercise these powers where media ownership rules continued to apply or where, before the passage of the Communications Act , no media ownership restrictions applied

CLAIM sentence: uk/ukpga///Section/  PART C | The PressC\xc(b) (c) (d) (e) s(B): the need for, to the extent that it is reasonable and practicable, a sufficient plurality of views in newspapers in each market for newspapers in the UK or a part of the UK; s(C)(a): the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience; s(C)(b): the need for the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of broadcasting which (taken as a whole) is both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and s(C)(c): the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to the attainment in relation to broadcasting of the standards objectives set out in s of the Communications Act 

CLAIM sentence:  These require, among other things, that news included in television and radio services is reported with due impartiality and the impartiality requirements of s

CLAIM sentence:  are complied with and that news is reported with due accuracy

CLAIM sentence:  An enterprise is a media enterprise if it consists of or involves broadcasting; but where the public interest concern is that as set out in s(C)(a) and a merger involves only one broadcasting company, a merger is still a media merger of media enterprises if the other company is a newspaper enterprise

CLAIM sentence:  The first of these occasions, the completed acquisition by British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (BSkyB) of a 

CLAIM sentence:  A newspaper company is an enterprise consisting in or involving the supply of newspapers (Section A())

CLAIM sentence:  A newspaper is a daily, Sunday or local (other than daily or Sunday) newspaper circulating wholly or mainly in the UK or in a part of the UK (Section ())  p, para 

CLAIM sentence:  The second occasion, the proposed acquisition by News Corporation of the shares in BSkyB it did not already own, was an EC merger

CLAIM sentence:  history of the newspaper ownership regime Before the Communications Act  

CLAIM sentence:  Since  there has been a separate regime in place in respect of newspaper mergers

CLAIM sentence:  Proprietors had to obtain prior consent from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (as was) before acquiring a newspaper (or newspaper assets) where the total paid-for daily circulation of the newspapers involved was , or more

CLAIM sentence:  Exceptions to this rule meant that the Secretary of State: (a) could consent to a transfer without a CC reference if he was satisfied that the newspaper was not economic as a going concern and that, if it was to continue as a separate newspaper, the case was urgent (s()(a) of the FTA); (b) had to consent to a transfer without a CC reference if he was satisfied that the newspaper concerned was not economic as a going concern and that it was not intended to continue as a separate newspaper (s()(b) of the FTA); and  http://webarchive

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART C | The PressC\xc(c) could consent to a transfer without a reference to the CC if he was satisfied that the newspaper being taken over had average daily sales of , or less (s() of the FTA)

CLAIM sentence:  Communications Act  The Communications Act  was designed to replace the FTA regime with a streamlined and less burdensome process that focused regulatory action on those few newspaper transfers that appeared to raise competition or plurality concerns

CLAIM sentence:  Under the Communications Act  there is no longer a requirement for the Secretary of States prior consent to newspaper transfers

CLAIM sentence:  The new regime applies to all transfers that satisfy the jurisdictional criteria for mergers in the Enterprise Act (broadly speaking, the turnover of the body being acquired exceeds m or the merger would result in market-share of % or more), meaning that the smallest local newspapers were removed from regulation altogether

CLAIM sentence:  Developments since : local media assessment The interim Digital Britain report included an invitation to the Office of Fair Trading to conduct a review of the local and regional media merger regime

CLAIM sentence:  This included amending OFT guidance to ensure that, where a local media merger raised prima facie competition issues, the OFT would ask Ofcom to provide a Local Media Assessment (LMA) covering relevant factors arising from their understanding of media markets

CLAIM sentence:  Ofcom has to date conducted one Local Media Assessment, concerning the proposed acquisition by Kent Messenger Group (KMG) of seven newspaper titles owned by Northcliffe Media

CLAIM sentence:  According to KMG The costs and time required for a full Competition Commission review would be completely unreasonable for a business of our size and for a deal of this scale

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, it has been contended by some witnesses to the Inquiry that the six documents that form the backdrop to this chapter bear telling testament to a misplaced faith in the ability of the industry to develop and lead self-regulatory systems capable of offering appropriate real redress to those who have been wronged, and of constituting a sufficient solution to problems of unethical and unlawful behaviour in the newspaper industry

CLAIM sentence:  For my part, I do not doubt that, at its best, British journalism is and has historically been world-beating: it has uncovered scandal, reported on significant events, and campaigned on issues of importance with both decency and integrity

CLAIM sentence:  The share which the newspaper industry holds of the wider communications market has been steadily eroded, first by radio and then the advent and growth of television

CLAIM sentence:  Television has moved from one initial offering by the BBC to the explosion of channels available through the introduction of satellite television services and, further, with the continuation of this trend through the rollout of digital television

CLAIM sentence:  The loss of market share has been further exacerbated by the internet and the increasing availability of mixed media services through that medium

CLAIM sentence:  The NUJ resolution reflected growing concern about the influence of a small group of newspaper publishers who had substantively increased their share of the national newspaper market in the inter-war period

CLAIM sentence:  In part, the concerns articulated in the resolution of the NUJ and the Parliamentary motion reflected understandable public disquiet at a return to business as usual by the newspaper industry after the war years (which had entailed strict Government control of all content, print as well as the means of distribution)

CLAIM sentence:  Among other things, the PEP groups final report argued for the establishment of a voluntary Press Tribunal led by an independent Chairman and supported by a panel of experts drawn from the newspaper industry

CLAIM sentence:  When the Royal Commission reported in , it made a number of damning findings

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, the Commission recommended that the Press Council be made up of  members, a proportion of whom (some %) would be appointed from outside the industry and would ensure that lay interests were adequately represented

CLAIM sentence:  That response was seen as concentrating too much power in the hands of already powerful newspaper proprietors, and paying too little heed to many of the recommendations contained in the report

CLAIM sentence:  To deal with what appeared to be a palpable lack of progress and refusal on the part of the newspaper industry to grapple with the fundamental criticisms and concerns at the heart of the Royal Commissions report, in November  the Labour backbench MP, CJ Simmons, with the backing of a number of members of the Shadow Cabinet, introduced a Private Members Bill

CLAIM sentence:  The threat of statutory regulation quickly persuaded newspaper publishers to come to an agreement that was deemed satisfactory to the Conservative Government, which then took action to prevent a second reading of the Bill

CLAIM sentence:  Significantly, proposals for lay representation on the Press Council, including the appointment of Chairman from outside the industry, had been dropped

CLAIM sentence:  The Media Standards Trust has noted in its submission to the Inquiry the prescience of the final contribution made by CJ Simmons to the Parliamentary debates on the establishment the Press Council, in which he said:  Great Britain () Op cit, p  Snoddy, R, The Good, the Bad, and the Unacceptable: The hard news about the British press, p  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op Cit, p  ibid, pp-  ibid, p  OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xc[To] give the voluntary Press Council a chance to prove its worth, efficiency and competence to do the job to which it has set its hand, I give warning here and now that if it fails some of us will again have to come forward with a measure similar to this Bill

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Shawcross, a former Labour Attorney General and then President of the Board of Trade, later becoming a cross-bench peer, was appointed Chairman of the second Royal Commission

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Shawcross was a passionate defender of press freedoms and had spoken publicly on the subject on a number of occasions

CLAIM sentence:  Its primary purpose was to look at the costs of production, printing and distribution as well as at the nascent impact of television on readership and advertising revenues, and to consider whether these factors had affected the diversity of ownership and control

CLAIM sentence:  The terms of reference to the Commission explained it thus: 

CLAIM sentence:  It is a matter of some significance that Lord Shawcross commented on the failure to heed the lessons of the first Royal Commission: [h]ad they been carried out much of our own inquiry might have been unnecessary

CLAIM sentence:  These specifically included those recommendations relating to the monitoring and enforcement of standards, the involvement of lay representatives on the Council and its failure to heed recommendations relating to the monitoring of levels of newspaper ownership

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Shawcross said at the time: If

CLAIM sentence:  the Press is not willing to invest the Council with the necessary authority and to contribute the necessary finance the case for a statutory body with definite powers and the right to levy the industry is a clear one

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee on Privacy, chaired by Sir Kenneth Younger, was established to examine a number of issues relating to the personal privacy, including the responses of the Press Council to alleged breaches of privacy in the press

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Kenneth Younger was a barrister by training and former Labour Party politician who had served as a junior Home Office Minister in the Government of Clement Atlee

CLAIM sentence:  After leaving Parliament in , Sir Kenneth had campaigned for progressive political reform with regard to a number of social issues including the legalisation of homosexuality and reform of prison conditions

CLAIM sentence:  Much later, he was appointed first Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission

CLAIM sentence:  When it reported in , the McGregor Commission sought to explain the real difficulties it had faced in reaching its recommendations

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, where the call for reform was heeded and changes implemented, that implementation was partial and incomplete

CLAIM sentence:  As the Media Standards Trust has fairly pointed out, this repeated the: 

CLAIM sentence:  Of the recommendations made by the MacGregor Commission in relation to the Press Council, only those relating to lay representation, the appointment of a Conciliator and to the seeking of nominations from any source were adopted in full

CLAIM sentence:  This was, of course, a recommendation, not a suggestion

CLAIM sentence:   OMalley, T and C Soley, Op cit, p  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xcmisconduct

CLAIM sentence:  These included allegations of cheque book journalism in relation to the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, defamatory allegations made in The Sun about the singer, Elton John (which led to the award of record damages for libel in ), the coverage of the television presenter Russell Hartys illness and subsequent death in , and the coverage of the alleged behaviour of Liverpool football fans during the Hillsborough disaster in 

CLAIM sentence:  Some of these examples of breaches of privacy and defamatory reporting became stories in their own right

CLAIM sentence:  Perhaps unsurprisingly for an organisation that had its roots in the wider Labour movement, the CPF pointed to what it regarded as unnecessary and destructive hostility directed at the trade unions by newspaper proprietors

CLAIM sentence:  The Robertson Report was unsurprisingly critical of the performance of the Press Council, but recommended nevertheless that the organisation be granted one final opportunity to reform itself and demonstrate its efficacy as a regulator

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, under the leadership of its final Chairman Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, the Press Council made significant efforts better to represent ordinary people and the victims of press mistreatment

CLAIM sentence:  However, there is little evidence to suggest that such rulings were respected or observed by the industry

CLAIM sentence:  The first of the two Bills was laid before the House of Commons by a Conservative MP, John Browne

CLAIM sentence:  Introducing his Bill to Parliament, Mr Worthington expressed the hope that it would improve access to redress for those who had been the victims of press mistreatment and speed up the process of dealing with complaints

CLAIM sentence:  These Private Members Bills were not the only attempts by Parliamentarians to tackle perceived press wrong-doing and the seeming inability of the Press Council to police press excesses effectively, although they were the last before the eventual appointment of Sir David Calcutt in 

CLAIM sentence:  For example: In June  the Labour MP, Frank Allaun, presented a Bill to give members of the public the right to reply to allegations made against them in the press, or on radio or television

CLAIM sentence:  In December , Allaun introduced a second right of reply Bill to the House of Commons

CLAIM sentence:   the - Royal Commission explored but dismissed this option  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  O Malley, T and C Soley, Op Cit, pp-  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xc In January , the Conservative MP, Teddy Taylor, asked the Attorney General to review the remedies available to individuals, groups and organisations in the event of newspapers or the broadcasting media publicising inaccurate or misleading reports, and legal remedies available to newspapers and broadcasters in the event of industrial action looking to influence their content

CLAIM sentence:  In June , Alfred Dubs MP (Labour) pressed unsuccessfully for a Bill to make newspapers declare payments to non-regular contributors

CLAIM sentence:  These included the movement of a debate in the House of Lords by the Labour Peer, Lord Longford, on Tabloid press: moral standards, the introduction of an Unfair Reporting and Right of Reply Bill by the Labour MP, Ann Clywd, and the introduction of a Right of Privacy Bill by the Conservative MP, Bill Cash

CLAIM sentence:  The Government responded to this continual build-up of pressure for both the reform of the Press Council and the introduction of effective curbs on the worst excesses of press practice by appointing a Departmental Committee, chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC, to investigate the matter

CLAIM sentence:  Sir David was asked: 

CLAIM sentence:  These included: its ineffectiveness as an adjudicator; the lack of confidence in its independence from the newspaper industry; its tendency to reject large numbers of complaints; the lack of clarity in its selection and categorisation of complaints; the time taken to resolve contested cases; and the lack of effective sanctions in instances of proven breach

CLAIM sentence:  However, contrary to the expectations of a number of contemporary commentators, Sir David Calcutts first report did not advocate the introduction of statutory controls for the press

CLAIM sentence:  In this report, Sir David recognised that such change would pose a significant challenge for the press but was adamant that if the challenge should not be met, namely a less than overwhelming rate of compliance with the Commissions adjudications

CLAIM sentence: [or]

CLAIM sentence:  Sir David also made clear that the adjudication of complaints should be a clear and fast process and that, where a newspaper was demonstrated to be in breach of the code, an apology should be given to the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  It is noteworthy that Sir Davids report made no mention of sanctions and instead placed emphasis on the preparedness of the press to adhere to the adjudications of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The report recommended that the PCC should have an independent Chairman supported by a Commission made up of no more the twelve Commissioners

CLAIM sentence:  These would be appointed by a separate independent appointments commission which would select and appoint on the basis of merit alone

CLAIM sentence:  As had been the case after the second Royal Commission (but not other reviews less favourable to the press), the response of the industry was swift

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC was itself incorporated on  January  and, in a nod to the history of the self-regulation of the press as well as in recognition of his very real qualifications for the post, Lord McGregor was appointed as its first Chairman

CLAIM sentence:  However, the full Commission was  Bingham, A, Op cit, p  Home Office (), Op cit, p  Home Office, Op cit, p  Bingham, A, Op cit, p  Chapter  | The Historical BackgroundD\xcappointed directly by Lord McGregor, in direct contravention of the Calcutt Reports specific recommendation that there should be a fully independent appointments process

CLAIM sentence: \t The\tsecond\treport\tof\tSir\tDavid\tCalcutt\tQC 

CLAIM sentence:  Many of the recommendations made by Sir David Calcutt were either quietly shelved or ignored by the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Others were modified or implemented in a manner that benefitted the industry

CLAIM sentence:  Following the publication in The Sun of the detail of intimate conversations between the Princess of Wales and James Gilbey, and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (as she now is), the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor QC MP, gave a speech in July  in which he reflected widespread public anger at the actions of The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Mellor later complained that his stance on the need for reform of the press led to him being driven from office by a series of salacious stories about his private life although he acknowledges that the timing was coincidental

CLAIM sentence:  This was just before Mr Mellor had left office in the circumstances explained above

CLAIM sentence:  There, Sir David analysed the record of self-regulation by the press since the formation of the PCC in January 

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Davids assessment was forthright

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Submission-by-Lord-Soley-of- Hammersmith

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Davids second report made clear his view that the press was neither capable nor willing to initiate reforms that might constitute a credible alternative to statutory regulation

CLAIM sentence:  If the conclusions reached in Sir David Calcutts second report were damning of the PCC, the recommendations for change were equally alarming for the supporters of self-regulation

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, Sir Davids proposals were seen as a step too far by even the most adamantine critics of the press

CLAIM sentence:  However, the PCC did accept that some reform was required and under the leadership of its second Chairman, Lord Wakeham, changes were made to aspects of policy and procedure, largely to improve and expedite the complaints handling procedures

CLAIM sentence:  The weakness of the press response to the second Calcutt report, as part of an overall narrative, was demonstrated by an example provided by Lord Brooke, the Secretary of State for National Heritage between July  and September 

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Brooke described the matter thus: In the same way, another instance which I would quote from my own time, the episode of the Mirror in the first week of November , when the photographs were taken of Princess Diana working out in a gymnasium, had a very powerful effect on the behaviour of the press immediately, because they had been resisting anything that in any way related to either to Calcutt or to ourselves and indeed others, and then suddenly changed their minds when they realised that an episode as absurd as the Mirror episode, where the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission rebuked the Mirror the Sunday Mirror, in fact rebuked the Sunday Mirror for their behaviour, first led the Sunday Mirror to walk out of the Press Complaints Commission, and then to come back, and it was clear that some of the things that were being said to them about the degree of control that they had were actually being proved by reality

CLAIM sentence:  The Government did not immediately respond to Sir Davids second report

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, it waited until , when the Secretary of State for National Heritage, Virginia Bottomley MP, rejected his recommendation for statutory regulation and instead supported the package of reforms that had been proposed by Lord Wakeham

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard from witnesses who have sought to explain the nature of the Governments response

CLAIM sentence:  Sir John Major has told the Inquiry that, although a matter of concern to his Government, the conduct of the press could not be regarded as a priority, nor, he noted, was there any agreement within the Government on the most desirable way forward

CLAIM sentence:  He recounted that his Government had to contend with other more pressing and immediate demands, including the UKs exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Wednesday  September 

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Johns recollection of events has found a complementary echo in the evidence of Lord Brooke

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that there was little appetite in Cabinet for the statutory solution proposed by Sir David in his second report

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Brooke also explained that a number of legislative proposals, through which press intrusion might be addressed, had been put forward by different Government departments

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Brooke noted that although there was some agreement in Cabinet on bringing forward legislation to introduce criminal offences, there was less accord in relation to the introduction of a tort of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  He also noted that the reforms to the PCC proposed and then implemented by Lord Wakeham increasingly appeared to meet the needs set out by Sir David Calcutt without the requirement for time- consuming and controversial legislation

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith summarised industry thinking behind his appointment in this way: I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level, and this was my view of what I thought they probably wanted

CLAIM sentence:  Sir John Major explained why Lord Wakehams appointment might well have been valued by the industry itself: I mean, those who were at all queasy about it would then say, Look, here is one of our own, a very respected former Cabinet Minister who is actually chairing the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore, why dont we wait and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead with legislation? So his appointment did have a material effect upon views in the Parliamentary party

CLAIM sentence:  However, Lord Wakeham was not appointed simply for his political skills

CLAIM sentence:  In perhaps the most important respect, he shared the values which were most cherished to the industry which the PCC was regulating

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Wakeham explained that he was a strong supporter of both press freedom and self-regulation: I dont think you could be a chairman of a body that was running a system of self- regulation unless you believed in self-regulation

CLAIM sentence:  I think that would be a bit difficult

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst it is clear that the PCC did introduce reform during the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, including the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner tasked with the oversight of each and every complaint to do with privacy, these changes did not amount to the creation of the organisation envisaged by Sir David Calcutt in his first report, but rather a PCC that met the minimum requirements of a Government increasingly disinclined to effect major reforms of the system of press regulation and fearful of the political ramifications of any such change

CLAIM sentence:  But the frank evidence of Sir John Major is pertinent on this issue: In retrospect, yes

CLAIM sentence:  I mean, there were some things done

CLAIM sentence:  It has to be said on behalf of the PCC that it did make some changes

CLAIM sentence:  They were relatively trivial changes, but they were changes

CLAIM sentence:  And they also, if I remember correctly, appointed a privacy commissioner from among their numbers, a Professor Pinker, at the time

CLAIM sentence:  So there were things that they had done, and the hope that Stephen Dorrell is expressing there is that John Wakeham would be able to persuade the media, the press, to go a good deal further than they already had done

CLAIM sentence:  It was, as you say, aspirational

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith told the Inquiry that it was Government policy to seek to strengthen the system of self regulation and, in particular, to bring about changes in relation to sanctions, the definition of the public interest, and the issue of PCC pro-activity

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith made clear that he thought that tackling these three issues would effect far-reaching and lasting change in the attitudes of the industry such that the press should not slip back into old ways when the events of the past week have receded from recent memory

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is quite clear from the evidence both of Lord Smith and Lord Wakeham that the industry was unwilling to make concession in these respects

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence Lord Smith recalled a meeting with Lord Wakeham in which the latter said: If the government can keep up some external pressure on me, pushing me all the time to go a bit further, then that will be very helpful, he said, in enabling me to make better progress with the editors and proprietors

CLAIM sentence:  Even in the evidence of Lord Wakeham it is clear that his ability to broker a solution was severely circumscribed by the unwillingness of editors and proprietors to concede ground: bear in mind the changes in the code were not a matter for me; they were a matter for the editors under the arrangements, and I therefore had to move carefully to make sure the editors went along with what I wanted

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith recognised that one of the lessons from history was that the window of opportunity for reform was short

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith described these as: 

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Smith said that, following the death of Princess Diana, Lord Wakeham, and by extension the PCC, were stepping up to the plate and being a regulator

CLAIM sentence:  Evidently, the same dynamics that played in the aftermath of the reporting of the Royal Commissions and the reports of Sir David Calcutt were also apparent in the industrys response at this point

CLAIM sentence:  In this case, they were ably guided by the dextrous political hand of Lord Wakeham who moved swiftly and adroitly to secure political backing for an industry-led response to these events

CLAIM sentence:  In  Sir Christopher Meyer was appointed Chairman of the PCC, and the evolution of that organisation under his leadership is addressed elsewhere in this Report, in particular in Part J

CLAIM sentence:  The organisation which he inherited was hidebound by the structural and cultural constraints which this chapter has served to highlight

CLAIM sentence:  It would require a herculean task to break free from them

CLAIM sentence:  This chapter of the Report attempts to provide only a cursory glance at the recent history of the British press, but it is patent that many of the concerns and practices that led to the establishment of three Royal Commissions, a Committee on privacy and the two reviews led by Sir David Calcutt, are the same as those which have led to the establishment of this Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  This has been a history of strongly recurring themes

CLAIM sentence:  In the case of the  Royal Commission under Sir William Ross, there was a proposal that the press should have a general body of their own, and they showed no sign at all of doing anything about that until a backbench MP called Mr Simmons in / brought in a Private Members Bill, whereupon effectively almost instantly the press came around to the original recommendation in the Royal Commission

CLAIM sentence:  He continued: In the same way, in  I noticed the text of Mr Dorrells account of how the Calcutt  was set up, but its actual genesis was the report stage of Mr Worthingtons bill entitled Right of Reply in , and the government minister responding at the dispatch box on that bill basically foreshadowed Calcutt  in his response

CLAIM sentence:  Similar observations were made by the Media Standards Trust, which submitted to the Inquiry a detailed analysis of the cycle of industry-led reform

CLAIM sentence:  Dr Martin Moore argued that in the face of considerable public concerns prompting the Royal Commission and other investigations into the behaviour of the press, the industry has been unmoved until threatened with the Damoclean sword of some form of statutory regulation

CLAIM sentence:   Further, Dr Moore has said the paucity of reforms implemented by the industry has led to a cycle of subsequent commissions, often within a decade examining to all intents and purposes the same conduct that had originally generated those public concerns

CLAIM sentence:  The MediaWise Trust agreed, recalling with some concern that recommendations made by the Ross Commission in , repeated in the report of the Shawcross Commission of  and again by Lord McGregor in , have yet to be implemented, particularly with regard to the prominence of apologies and corrections

CLAIM sentence:  The historical lessons are clear enough, but the challenge for today is whether any of them will be taken on board

CLAIM sentence:  A more critical perspective requires a detailed analysis of the response of the PCC to allegations of systemic press misconduct (such as that which arose in relation to data protection following Operation Motorman and then to phone hacking following Operation Caryatid)

CLAIM sentence:  As has already been explained above, the PCC was set up following the first report into privacy and the press by Sir David Calcutt QC, published in 

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, in the spring of , the five publishing associations in the UK (the Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Society, the Periodical Publishers Association, Scottish Newspaper Publishers Association and the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society) worked together to establish the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) for the specific purpose of funding the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC was itself incorporated on  January 

CLAIM sentence:  Sir David made clear that the adjudication of complaints should be a clear and fast process and that, where a newspaper was demonstrated to be in breach of the code, an apology should be given to the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  In July , Sir David Calcutt was asked by Mr Mellor to prepare a second report analysing the record of self-regulation by the press since the formation of the PCC in January 

CLAIM sentence:  Reiterating the history set out above, the PCC and the industry more widely both rejected the analysis of Sir David

CLAIM sentence:  These were Lord MacGregor (); Lord Wakeham (); Sir Christopher Meyer (-); Baroness Buscombe (-); and Lord Hunt (since  October )

CLAIM sentence:  Professor Robert Pinker served as Acting Chair from July to October 

CLAIM sentence:  Membership of the PCC is voluntary and as such there is no system of sanctions or incentives in place to induce those newspapers and magazines who do not subscribe to the PCC to do so

CLAIM sentence:  Currently, the majority of national newspapers do subscribe to the PCC but there are important and significant omissions to that membership

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, the Northern and Shell group withdrew its membership in January  and, as a consequence, the Star and Express titles have not been subject to any system of self-regulation since then (although Dawn Neesom, the editor of The Star, explained in her evidence that staff at both titles continued to abide by the terms of the Editors Code of Practice during this period)

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the majority of national newspapers, all regional titles and most magazine titles are currently members of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Subscription to the PCC is organised through the five print trade associations: the Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Society, the Periodical Publishers Association and the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society

CLAIM sentence:  The structure of the PCC The framework for the membership of the PCC and appointments to the PCC are set out in Articles - of the Articles of Association

CLAIM sentence:  There are a number of classes of member of the  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  It is of critical importance to note that, under the Articles of Association, PressBoF has absolute discretion to appoint the Chair on whatever terms it sees fit, and to vary or revoke that appointment

CLAIM sentence: , which provides that the Chairman shall not be engaged in or connected with or interested in the business of publishing newspapers, periodicals or magazines (other than through his appointment as Chairman)

CLAIM sentence:  For example, Sir Christopher Meyer was Press Secretary to Sir John Major from  to ; during his tenure as Prime Minister and, before his appointment, Lord Hunt had prepared a report on the future regulation of solicitors for the Law Society of England; prior to that, he had led the first review of the Financial Ombusdman Service

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the Inquiry has been told that a belief in the superiority of self-regulation above other forms of regulation is a requirement for all candidates applying for the post

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence submitted by Lord Hunt included a copy of the advertisement for the post of PCC Chair as it was advertised in 

CLAIM sentence:  The advertisement stated that candidates for the post of PCC Chair: must be committed to the principles of self-regulation and freedom for the press

CLAIM sentence:  For example, Lord Grade was asked at interview whether or not he supported statutory regulation, and Sir Christopher Meyer suggested that he regarded his tenure as PCC Chair as a success as he warded off the threat of statutory regulation

CLAIM sentence:  The then Director of the PCC, Stephen Abell, provided detailed evidence to the Inquiry about the function and operation of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  According to the PCCs response to the  Independent Governance Review, oral hearings would be undesirable because they might undermine two key virtues of the PCC system, namely that the system is free and fair

CLAIM sentence:  On occasion, the PCC coordinates with publications and complainants who are at the centre of a specific news story

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC can send a private advisory note to editors, making it clear that an individual does not want to speak to the media

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has developed a system whereby it can communicate the request of a complainant to an individual newspaper or to the whole print and broadcast industry

CLAIM sentence:  Since , the PCC has operated a -hour helpline, the number for which is advertised on the PCC website

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is notable that this has been used only rarely, and only in circumstances in which individuals have been placed under sustained, intense and intrusive media speculation

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC only deals with complaints relating to an article in a newspaper, magazine or periodi- cal, or on the website of a newspaper, magazine or periodical

CLAIM sentence:  Although criticised by a number of witnesses (including Dr Martin Moore and Professor Greenslade) as inadequate, Baroness Buscombe told the Inquiry that the current sanctions regime available to the PCC had been broadly effective

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, in its response to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee report, the PCC said at present, the Commission believes that its powers are effective and can point to a culture in which its sanctions have real impact

CLAIM sentence:  Both Baroness Buscombe and Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry that the possibility of an adverse adjudication on an editor of a newspaper was a real and effective sanction

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Christopher said that editors would go to considerable lengths to avoid an adverse adjudication and that this was to the benefit of the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  Baroness Buscombe went further, observing that editors reacted with fury to the announcement of an adverse PCC adjudication and that the effect of such an adjudication on an editor was considerable

CLAIM sentence:  In so doing, Baroness Buscombe has implied that the deterrent and punitive effect of a PCC adjudication was real

CLAIM sentence:  Baroness Buscombe also explained that both the Daily Mirror and the Financial Times had threatened to leave the PCC as a consequence of an adverse adjudication

CLAIM sentence:  She accepted the suggestion of the Inquiry that this reflected that the balance of power within the self- regulatory system for the press may be wrong

CLAIM sentence:  However, she was emphatic that, although  para  et seq

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript- of-Morning-Hearing--February-

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has been told that this was the source of some frustration to complainants, and indeed, had dissuaded some from taking complaints to the PCC in the first instance

CLAIM sentence:  The position of Charter Commissioner was introduced in , together with a Charter Compliance Panel, as part of the policy of permanent evolution initiated by Sir Christopher Meyer

CLAIM sentence:  The first Charter Commissioner was Sir Brian Cubbon, who served until 

CLAIM sentence:  He was replaced by Sir Michael Wilcocks (who became the first Independent Reviewer)

CLAIM sentence:  Such guidance has been produced on a range of subjects including: the reporting of suicide (developed together with the Samaritans); the reporting of people accused of crimes; payments to parents for material about their children and the reporting of court cases involving sex offences

CLAIM sentence:  PressBoF, is responsible for the organisation and collection of the levy which funds the PCC from the newspapers and periodicals participating in it

CLAIM sentence:  Currently, three members of the PressBoF Board are drawn from the Newspaper Association; three members from the Newspaper Society; two from the Periodical Publishers Association and two from the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society

CLAIM sentence:  The Board members are appointed by their trade association and in turn appoint the Chair, currently Lord Black of Brentwood (who, between  and  was the Director of the PCC)

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has heard detailed evidence from Lord Black, who has been Chair since September , which has helped to explain the role of PressBoF as to the function of the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that PressBoF not only funded the PCC through the collection and disbursement  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black explained that this was to ensure that no substantive changes were made to the role of the PCC without consultation with the industry

CLAIM sentence:  In part, this was enforced through an undertaking made by Commissioners, on their appointment to the PCC, not to agree any changes to the articles of association without the express permission of PressBoF

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black also explained the generality of the PCC funding arrangements

CLAIM sentence:  Payments by national newspapers accounted for % of the levy, regional newspapers paid % of the levy and magazines paid the remaining %

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black explained that, each year, PressBoF asked the national press through the National Newspaper Association to pay a specified amount towards the levy

CLAIM sentence:  The contribution from each member of the NPA was decided by a formula derived from the amount of news print consumed by each member and the number of publications owned by each member

CLAIM sentence:  This calculation was made through the NPA as some of the information needed to deduce the level of contributions to the levy was commercially sensitive

CLAIM sentence:  The monies collected through the levy were collected and passed on to PressBoF twice each year

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black made the point that the appointment process had not been static but had changed, becoming increasingly transparent, over time: he noted that the appointment of the first Chairman of the PCC, Lord Wakeham in , was done effectively by a tap on the shoulder, with no outside scrutiny or independent influence

CLAIM sentence:  By comparison, Lord Black explained that the appointment of Sir Christopher Meyer in  involved the use of specialist recruitment consultants

CLAIM sentence:  However, it is important to note that, although lay members of the PCC were involved in the appointment of Lord Hunt in , they owned no formal role in the process

CLAIM sentence:  The appointment of Lord Hunt incorporated these changes for the first time

CLAIM sentence:  A firm of recruitment consultants, Korn, Ferry, Whitehead, Mann, were appointed to manage the process for the first time and an independent assessor was also appointed to oversee the process

CLAIM sentence:  A subcommittee of five members was involved in the interview process

CLAIM sentence:  The involvement of lay members was indirect

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the Deputy Chair of the Commission, Ian Nichol, was appointed to liaise between the independent assessor and the recruitment consultants to monitor the process

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black rejected the notion, put to him by Robert Jay QC, that, in practice, the position of PCC Chair was a de facto political one, on the basis that the post did not deal with political matters

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black also noted that Lord MacGregor of Durris, the first Chairman of the PCC, was a Liberal Democrat Peer

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black told the Inquiry that the politics of Lord Hunt, the fourth Conservative Party peer to have held the post of PCC Chair, had played no role in his appointment

CLAIM sentence:  The Code Committee is made up of editors appointed by the relevant trade bodies of the newspaper and magazine industry

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black has said that representation of serving editors on the Committee of the Editors Code of Practice is a basic requirement for the success of the system of self-regulation

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, Lord Black categorically rejected the notion that that the Code Committee was not suitably independent of either PressBoF or the industry more widely

CLAIM sentence:  He told the Inquiry that, whilst PressBoF provided funding to the PCC, and although PressBoF, through the Code Committee, determined the Code, the independence of the complaints process by the PCC was sacrosanct

CLAIM sentence:  Importantly, Lord Black clarified that the Editors Code of Practice Committee was a part of PressBoF and not the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, a number of editors told the Inquiry that such input to the Code was crucial if the Code was to have sufficient credibility with the industry

CLAIM sentence:  The same point was also made by Lord Hunt, who stated that it was important that any rules for the press, particularly around standards, were written by professionals with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Grade accepted that the codes developed by the Communications regulator Ofcom did not suffer because input came from former rather  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This was in the context of the Mail on Sunday having made payments to Baroness Scotlands housekeeper

CLAIM sentence:  On that occasion, the Editors Code Committee took legal advice from Mr Jonathan Caplan QC, and that advice was relayed to the PCC by Ian Beales

CLAIM sentence:  According to the PCC, the Code protects both the rights of the individual and the publics right to know

CLAIM sentence:  They should take care to ensure it is observed rigorously by all editorial staff and external contributors, including non-journalists, in printed and online versions of publications

CLAIM sentence:  The Media Standards Trust, for example, said:  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black was asked about criticisms that the Committee was slow to respond or adapt to criticism, that it had put the system of self-regulation ahead of the needs of individuals, particularly those who had been subject to abuse and mistreatment by the press, and had not looked critically or objectively at the efficacy of the system

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, Lord Black noted improvements in behaviour related to harassment and the treatment of children and hospital patients

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Black was particularly keen to make clear to the Inquiry that one of the primary functions of PressBoF, as a body that represented the industry, was forcefully to promote press freedom

CLAIM sentence:  To illustrate his point, Lord Grade provided the example of complaints to the BBC about Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand in October 

CLAIM sentence:  The BBC Trust was able to issue an apology and a correction within ten days, whereas Ofcom took almost three months to investigate the same complaint and reach broadly similar conclusions

CLAIM sentence:  Like other witnesses to the Inquiry, Lord Hunt has argued that it is the press who are in best position to correct the perceived failings with the current system of self-regulation and develop a solution that is more appropriate for dealing with the issues described to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  She has argued that such a change would have made the system more adversarial and would have necessitated the involvement of lawyers in decision making, leading to drawn out processes which would have resulted in a lesser service to the public

CLAIM sentence:  By contrast, Lord Hunt argued, an independent regulator could make changes in a more timely fashion

CLAIM sentence:  The service was regarded by the PCC as an important complement to Clause  (harassment) of the Editors Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  Although the PCC has no formal responsibility for broadcast journalists, as these are not covered by the terms of the Editors Code, the PCC has, as a rule, forwarded desist notices to broadcasters, who have then taken appropriate action to ensure that their journalists abide by the will of the desist notice

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Abells written evidence to the Inquiry noted that: This helps to reduce the problem of media scrums that involve journalists from all forms of media

CLAIM sentence:  The anti-harassment service is accessed through the -hour helpline operated by the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  This email then becomes in effect the desist notice,  p, Lord Hunt, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf?  Part D | StandardsD\xcwhich the PCC will then forward to a list of senior editorial and legal representatives

CLAIM sentence:  I note that Mr Abell has written that: Almost invariably, it is followed and the attention ceases

CLAIM sentence:  This guidance encourages the bereaved to use the anti-harassment service

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Abell stated: The starting premise is that as soon as an editor publishes a photograph, he or she is taking responsibility for the conduct of the person providing it

CLAIM sentence:  This in turn means that non-compliant photographs are not bought by newspapers or magazines, and the market for them dwindles

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Abells written evidence explained that, as a class, the paparazzi were not regulated through any formal mechanism

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore, restricting the market for paparazzi photographs that may have been taken in breach of the code, or in contravention of a desist notice, helped to enforce standards of behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  I have heard little evidence that has been critical of the anti-harassment service operated by the PCC and it would be appropriate, therefore, to restrict myself to some general comments only

CLAIM sentence:  I note, first, that the service appears to be well regarded

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has provided me with evidence of the efficacy of this service in helping those in often extraordinary circumstances  Part D | StandardsD\xcto benefit either from a desist notice or in helping affected parties manage press and other media interest

CLAIM sentence:  It is to be borne in mind that although the events Mr McManus has described were extraordinary, they illustrate well the services the PCC is able to offer those individuals who become the subject of intense press attention

CLAIM sentence:  Mr McManus has written that: On the day of the shootings, a member of PCC staff spoke briefly to Cumbria Police and followed up immediately with an email providing our contact details and explaining how we could help deal with concerns about media scrums and prepublication issues

CLAIM sentence:  Mr McManus noted that during this difficult period members of PCC staff were in regular contact with police communicators

CLAIM sentence:  I note that the then Director of the PCC, Mr Abell, travelled on  July  to Cumbria to meet with police communicators, local clergy and the editor of the Whitehaven News

CLAIM sentence:  The Whitehaven News subsequently published a letter from Mr Abell setting out the PCCs services, and encouraging people to make contact with the PCC if they wished to do so

CLAIM sentence:  Mr McManus notes that: The PCC stayed in touch with the police after the shootings, and also initiated contact with the local Coroner

CLAIM sentence:  Mr McManus has  pp-, lines -, Gillian Shearer, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Michael McManus evidence is available on the Inquirys website  Michael McManus evidence is available on the Inquirys website  Chapter  | Self-regulation of the Press\xcalso told the Inquiry that following these events, the PCC has amended the guidance it offers to families in dealing with the media following a death

CLAIM sentence:  This is not to say that there are still not concerns with the anti-harassment service that should not be elaborated

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC website states: There are a number of practical steps that you can take to avoid unwanted or repeated approaches: 

CLAIM sentence:  Get the name of the journalist and the newspaper or news agency for which they work

CLAIM sentence:  Tell them politely that you do not wish to speak to them and that they should not contact you again

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, if you are being telephoned repeatedly and do not wish to speak to journalists, alter your answerphone message to say that only personal callers should leave a message as you are not speaking to the media

CLAIM sentence:  Some people particularly at times of grief or shock find it helpful to ask a friend or neighbour who is not as closely associated with the story to deal with press enquiries

CLAIM sentence:  In so doing, the website makes no claim to the certainty of success of any action on the part of the PCC in this regard

CLAIM sentence:  However, this option is not available to the PCC as very few UK newspapers have formal complaints processes beyond the discretion of the editor

CLAIM sentence:  The figures for , reported by the PCC in , are the most recent full figures available, and are broadly similar to those received up to 

CLAIM sentence: php  PCC Statistics: a critical analysis by the Media Standards Trust, p http://mediastandardstrust

CLAIM sentence: org/wp-content/ uploads/downloads///PCC-Statistics

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Hunt said in evidence that that the satisfaction rate among complainants to the PCC was very high

CLAIM sentence:  However, this figure has been called into question by other evidence submitted to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Christopher Meyer gave evidence that, in most cases, resolutions were reached within a month of the complaint first being lodged

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC website makes clear that the Commission will deal with complaints as expeditiously as it is able

CLAIM sentence:  The website points to an average turnaround for the resolution of complaints of 

CLAIM sentence:  The Media Standards Trust notes that, although such complaints are passed on to the relevant body or organisation, they are regarded by the PCC as resolved

CLAIM sentence:  The Media Standards Trust suggests that the inclusion of such cases therefore serves to distort both rates of satisfaction, as well as the record of the time taken to resolve a complaint

CLAIM sentence:  The Media Standards Trust deduced from available PCC data that the actual figure of turnaround was an average of  working days, three times greater than the PCC figure

CLAIM sentence:  Who can complain The website states that the PCC is an independent body, which has been set up to examine complaints about the editorial content of UK newspapers and magazines (and their websites)

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC website explains that the Commission will deal with all editorially-controlled material in UK newspapers and magazines (and their websites)

CLAIM sentence:  Examples are provided: Articles and pictures; Words and pictures (including video) on newspaper and magazine websites; Audio material on newspaper and magazine websites; Readers letters; and, Edited or moderated reader comments on newspaper and magazine websites

CLAIM sentence:  Most importantly, the website makes clear that the PCC will only normally accept complaints only from those who are directly affected by the matters about which they are complaining

CLAIM sentence:  It explains that individuals who meet that criterion are able to make complaints to the PCC and may raise complaints through the Commission against any newspaper, magazine or publication which subscribed to PressBoF

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, Mr Abell explained that it was not the policy of the PCC to take account of complaints from third parties

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard the case of Stephen Gately is instructive

CLAIM sentence:  In response, the PCC contacted Mr Gatelys partner and asked if he would consider submitting a complaint

CLAIM sentence:  Beyond the strict timeframe set down by the PCC for the initial submission of the complaint, however, the times for each subsequent element of the complaints-handling process are not specified and no guidance is provided as to the likely duration of that process

CLAIM sentence:  However, the PCC has no powers to stipulate the form of resolution that might be offered by the newspaper in question

CLAIM sentence:  According to an analysis undertaken by the Inquiry of complaints to the PCC between January  and May , declared to have been resolved during that period, the time taken to resolve a case can vary significantly

CLAIM sentence:  In the fastest example, the resolution of a complaint took one month; in the slowest case  p, para , ibid  http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/cases/adjudicated

CLAIM sentence:  Will Moy of Full Fact stated that whilst some complaints resulted in a prompt response from the newspaper in question, sometimes within a day of two, in other cases the process of reply was much slower, taking as many as  days

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC website provides details of a total of , complaints that have been the subject of PCC rulings since 

CLAIM sentence:  It lists  such complaints in , (as set out in Table D

CLAIM sentence: % were informally resolved, 

CLAIM sentence: % of cases the PCC found that the newspaper question had taken sufficient remedial action to declare the complaint resolved

CLAIM sentence: : Complaints to the pCC: - D total number of complaints resolved upheld against adjudicated Complaints no

CLAIM sentence:  But Mr Abell suggested that the position of the complaints handler was one of neutrality: So I dont think its a neutral act by complaints people

CLAIM sentence:  I think their job is to grip the issues and to try and bring them to a conclusion, and that will invariably be by assisting the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, Mr Abell suggested that there was no validity in the assertion that the PCCs preferred outcome of a mediated resolution was in the better interest of editors and newspapers rather than the complainant

CLAIM sentence:  An Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press might not be thought to engage or require detailed consideration of the law but, as many witnesses have correctly identified, the starting point from which any assessment of the way in which the press goes about its business must be the general framework of the law

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example, aspects of the behaviour of Neville Thurlbeck as he pursued a follow up to his scoop relating to Max Mosley were described by Mr Justice Eady in the ensuing civil litigation as containing a clear threat to the women involved that unless they cooperated (albeit in exchange for some money) making the point that it was elementary that blackmail can be committed by the threat to do something which would not, in itself, be unlawful

CLAIM sentence:  Blackmail is not, however, a crime that is covered in this Appendix

CLAIM sentence:  There is no doubt room for other potential offences to be engaged in the unprincipled pursuit of a story

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, the milestones that led to this Inquiry include: E (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) the publicity accorded to the investigations by the Information Commissioner through reports to Parliament and discussions with the PCC; the outcome of each of the criminal prosecutions and, in particular in relation to Operation Caryatid, the police strategy adopted thereafter; the reaction of the press (and, in particular, the News of the World) to the prosecutions along with the response of the PCC; the impact of civil litigation; the investigations undertaken by the Guardian and, subsequently, the New York Times along with the reactions of the police and Parliament to each of the articles; the further civil litigation and the proceedings for judicial review of the strategy adopted by the police following the successful prosecutions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire; the re-opening of the criminal investigation and the reactions thereafter of News International, the PCC and Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  The narrative then passes to Operation Caryatid, the police investigation of interception of voicemail messages (phone hacking) and its consequences, which continue to be felt today

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of the operation, initially, was to scope the material that had been seized during the blackmail investigation, with the following terms of reference: (a) (b) (c) to investigate the alleged offences and conduct interviews of the individuals identified as being in jeopardy; to establish links with other agencies to identify individuals who had unlawfully revealed confidential information, and to preserve evidence in support of suspected offences and to interview those individuals; and to report to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Police Complaints Authority

CLAIM sentence:  In particular, the police found that a small number of police officers who had retired from the Devon and Cornwall Police had set themselves up as private investigators for the commercial market and were obtaining information from former colleagues who were still working within the police service or other agencies, such as the Department for Work and Pensions

CLAIM sentence:  The customers were found to be requesting either specific pieces of information or packages, which could include a persons criminal background, their financial situation, medical history, telephone records and current whereabouts

CLAIM sentence:  The relevant forces were contacted, including the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the police forces of Dorset, Northumbria, Surrey and Essex

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Middleton explained that the CPS and the Police Complaints Authority advised the police to focus the investigation on (i) individuals who were either systematically providing or receiving information unlawfully from databases, and (ii) the customers who knew or ought to have known that the information had been obtained unlawfully

CLAIM sentence:  The initial information, as we said, linked pretty much specifically to a local investigation, detective private investigation agency in Devon and the flow of information was from the police officer and the other staff Ive mentioned through to that private investigator, up one or two more chains, and we were tracking customers each and every occasion, open-minded as to who those customers would be, and we never found any direct evidence or indirect evidence linking that information being requested by or for any part of the media or journalists

CLAIM sentence:  In his witness statement, DCS Middleton said that: There was no direct evidence found during the course of the investigation that any media organisation was in any way involved in the obtaining of illicit information being investigated 

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Glade is an example of a police investigation which, on the face of it, may be thought to demonstrate partiality or favour to journalists which, it is argued, has been rendered  p, lines -, Lord Justice Leveson, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  As we have seen above, Devon and Cornwall Police had also searched the premises of the data gathering company, Data Research Ltd; this was the corporate alter ego of Mr John Boyall

CLAIM sentence:  Evidence was obtained that indicated he was involved in the same types of activity as Mr Whittamore

CLAIM sentence:  The investigation (Operation Glade), began in August  with Detective Chief Inspector Mick Allen appointed as the Senior Investigating Officer and DCI Brendan Gilmour (then Detective Inspector Gilmour) as the Investigating Officer

CLAIM sentence:  Through analysis of telephone data relating to Mr Marshall, the Operation Glade investigators established that a retired police sergeant, Alan King, had been acting as the conduit between Mr Marshall on the one hand and Mr Boyall and Mr Whittamore on the other

CLAIM sentence:  There was no evidence that any other police personnel were involved

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , Mr King was arrested

CLAIM sentence:  Meanwhile, from the very detailed ledgers of Mr Whittamores business, the investigators found invoices to journalists setting out what information was sought and his fee for obtaining that information

CLAIM sentence:  Contrary to the approach adopted in relation to Mr King, on or around  January  DCI Gilmour decided to interview the journalists identified in the ledgers under caution (and therefore as suspects) but also decided, as an operational matter, not to arrest them, but to invite them to attend voluntarily for interview

CLAIM sentence:  The difference in approach was explained on the basis that DCI Gilmour was confident that the attendance of the journalists could be secured voluntarily, whereas the same was not so in relation to Mr King

CLAIM sentence:  Whereas King, I didnt have that access to King and it was necessaryto secure his attendance at the police station for investigation interview by arresting himfor every suspect, its a consideration as to whether or not they need to be arrested in order to achieve what it is you want to achieve

CLAIM sentence:  All the journalists admitted that they had used Mr Whittamore to obtain information but each denied knowing that the information was being obtained unlawfully

CLAIM sentence:  DCI Gilmour made it clear that it was put to them in interview that they must have known that Mr Whittamore was not obtaining the information from a court office because of the speed of turnaround of the requests, sometimes a matter of hours

CLAIM sentence:  However, each adhered to the line and claimed that he would not have used Mr Whittamore or any agency had it been known that the information was being obtained unlawfully

CLAIM sentence:  DCI Gilmour explained his disappointment at the view of the CPS that they could not prove the necessary guilty knowledge

CLAIM sentence:  DCI Gilmour explained that for a number of legal reasons, on which he was not able to elaborate, counsel advised against this course of action

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, on  March , a team of investigators led by Alexander Owens from the ICO, and alongside police officers from Operation Reproof, searched the premises of the private detective agency run by Mr Whittamore

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Owens and his team then undertook a comprehensive analysis of the seized material and observed a clear audit trail between the requests, supply and payment for personal information relating to a range of subjects

CLAIM sentence:  The customers requesting and being supplied with personal information included a significant number of journalists, employed by a range of newspaper and magazine titles

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , during the course of the search of the premises of Data Research Ltd, as part of Operation Reproof, Mr Owens observed documents containing lists of Vehicle Registration Marks (VRMs) that appeared to have been checked for vehicle owners personal details

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Owens contacted the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) with a number of the listed VRMs and the DVLA confirmed that all the numbers has been searched through the DVLA records by the same employee

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Owens also confirmed that the times and dates recorded on the seized documents corresponded with the times and dates when the DVLA records had been checked

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of these facts, Mr Owens formed the view that a source within DVLA had been supplying information on request to the detective agency

CLAIM sentence:  The ICO commenced Operation Motorman to investigate data protection offences and, in particular, to identify the customers of the agency who had commissioned the supply of information and the reasons why personal information of this nature had been sought

CLAIM sentence:  Thereafter, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) commenced Operation Glade to identify potential corruption by police officers or civilian police employees

CLAIM sentence:  On closer examination of the documents seized from the premises of Data Research, Mr Owens observed that one of the VRM checks had been made against a protected number

CLAIM sentence:  Having previously served as a Special Branch police officer, Mr Owens appreciated that a protected number was likely to signify a vehicle owned by a sensitive individual or an undercover police vehicle

CLAIM sentence:  This was confirmed by the MPS and Mr Owens identified Mr Whittamore and his company, JJ Services, as having sought the information in relation to this vehicle

CLAIM sentence:  As a result of this, Mr Owens explained, Stephen Whittamore immediately went to number  on [his] investigation list to be visited and interviewed

CLAIM sentence:  The ICO identified Mr Whittamore as a private detective running a business from his home address and, as has been explained above, on Saturday  March , five ICO investigators searched Mr Whittamores premises pursuant to a search warrant issued under Schedule  of the DPA

CLAIM sentence:  A significant volume of documentation was seized during the search of Mr Whittamores premises

CLAIM sentence:  These notebooks represented all the work that Mr Whittamore had done, and set out precise dealings between Mr Whittamore and his customers, including a number of journalists

CLAIM sentence:  The workbooks documented who had requested the personal information (both in terms of the newspaper concerned and the commissioning journalist), what information had been requested and supplied, how much had been charged for obtaining the information and how much was paid to associates who assisted in the supply of the information

CLAIM sentence:  Invoices and remittance advices demonstrated the payments made by newspaper groups and how much money had been paid for each transaction

CLAIM sentence:  As Mr Owens explained in his evidence, he was able to demonstrate a paper trail from identified journalists working for named newspaper groups, requesting information be obtained, through to the subsequent activities of the private investigators using sources or blaggers to obtain the information

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Owens, assisted by ICO Investigator Roy Pollitt, created a photo image of each of the documents and pages of the notebooks, and sent the documents to a forensic computer specialist to input the information into an electronic database, thus converting the contents of Mr Whittamores notebooks, invoices, remittance advices into an electronic format

CLAIM sentence:  November  Mr Owens made a copy of the electronic database available to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Its broad accuracy was confirmed when the ICO produced Mr Whittamores hardback coloured notebooks

CLAIM sentence:  During Mr Owens evidence, I observed that the records kept by Mr Whittamore, as illustrated in the database, contained, by reference to each request, the name of the newspaper group, the newspaper within that group, the journalists first and last names, the service requested, the name of the person retrieving the information (for example the blagger), the subject about whom the information was requested, the result of the search and various accompanying comments

CLAIM sentence:  These aspects of the evidence are now considered in some detail

CLAIM sentence:  Volume of requests made to Mr Whittamore 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Owens expressed the view that the notebooks contained in the region of , entries, or requests for information from the press

CLAIM sentence:  This discrepancy is explained by their different approaches to multiple requests, and need not be resolved for present purposes

CLAIM sentence:  On any view, the figure involved is substantial, and demonstrates that Mr Whittamore was not simply engaged in obtaining the occasional ex- directory number, or in locating addresses on an infrequent basis, or in supplying personal information relating to simply a handful of individuals

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Operation MotormanE\xcpersonal information relating to hundreds of individual subjects, on an almost daily basis

CLAIM sentence:  However, the number of journalists requesting personal information from Mr Whittamore (for whatever reason, whether justifiable or not) indicates that it was not an isolated incident, or a handful of individuals engaging in the practice

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Thomas witness statement identifies some  journalists as having been named in the Motorman material, and whilst, again, I note the discrepancy between the figures, nothing turns on this difference

CLAIM sentence:  Suppliers of information The documents seized disclosed that the information was either obtained directly by Mr Whittamore, or through associates who would be paid to obtain the information through either blagging or paying a source

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Whittamore would commonly outsource work to associates in return for a payment, and add a premium to the value of the information sold to the end buyer

CLAIM sentence:  One of Mr Whittamores associates, Mr Jones, would ring BT or other phone companies, purporting to be an engineer; he would use a form of password which is given to BT employees (known as an EIN number) in order to identify himself as an engineer

CLAIM sentence:  Once he had obtained the information sought, he would telephone Mr Whittamore and pass on the relevant information

CLAIM sentence:  This modus operandi was elicited by Mr Owens from the relevant paperwork and by interviewing Mr Jones

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Owens confirmed that he had seen a reference to the Dowler family in the Operation Motorman material alongside a request for  Information Commissioners Office, What Price Privacy?, p, para

CLAIM sentence:  It also emerged in evidence that Mr Hugh Grant was amongst the celebrities whose personal information was sought by journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Nature of information The material seized evidenced the supply of a wide range of information including criminal record checks against the PNC, occupancy checks, voter searches, directors searches, VRM checks and vehicle owner details, ex-directory phone numbers, itemised telephone billing and mobile phone records, details of frequently dialled (friends and family) numbers, conversion of mobile telephone numbers into addresses and vice versa

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example of the type of information requested, in the course of Mr Owens evidence the Inquiry heard that one entry related to a request for specific calls from a telephone number between :hrs and :hrs on a given date

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Owens expressed the view that this information would be available on the subscribers telephone bill and this would only be available from the phone company

CLAIM sentence:  Another entry related to a request for a Phone bill for June  for the price of 

CLAIM sentence:  Thus, by its very nature, it appears clear that some types of information could only have been acquired from one possible source, for example the DVLA (VRM checks against owner details), the PNC (criminal record checks), or telephone companies (friends and family numbers)

CLAIM sentence:  As Mr Owens explained in relation to friends and family numbers, theres no way you can get somebodys list of family and friends lawfully, unless you actually know them and whats on the list

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Thomas in his evidence also confirmed that the PNC, and the list of friends and family numbers, cannot be obtained from information in the public domain

CLAIM sentence:  The particulars from the register may be made available in a number of particular circumstances, for example to a police officer, or to a local authority to investigate an offence

CLAIM sentence:  Putting it at its lowest, in respect of these types of information, namely VRMs checks against owner details, criminal record checks, or friends and family telephone numbers, I consider that the methods used to obtain this information by Mr Whittamore are highly likely to have been unlawful

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, searching through former telephone directories to locate a number that may have been notified before it became ex-directory may be possible

CLAIM sentence:  However, as was explained in What Price Privacy?, in many instances the sums charged for such information, for example the obtaining of a personal address, appeared to be too low to suggest that extensive hours of research had been undertaken to obtain this information

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Thomas expressed the view that it was highly likely that ex-directory numbers were obtained illegally

CLAIM sentence:  News International drew Mr Thomas attention to the fact that there exist substantial databases of telephone numbers which may well have been obtained lawfully: one of the largest holds in the region of  million numbers, of which approximately  million may be inferred to be ex-directory

CLAIM sentence:  However, it does not seem likely that Mr Whittamore had access to such a database between  and , and the way in which he recorded the information that he obtained does not suggest great computer literacy on his part

CLAIM sentence:  Further, it is difficult to see why newspapers (which, presumably, could access certain databases themselves) would have paid so highly for his services had such databases been his source

CLAIM sentence:  Taking all this evidence into account, and applying basic common sense to it, the fairly obvious conclusion is that Mr Whittamore was obtaining the ex-directory numbers by unlawful means

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to the public interest, he gave the example of seeking the weekend telephone number of a minister who had recently resigned in order to  Regulation  of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing Regulations)   p, lines -, Richard Thomas, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil LawE\xccontact him with a proposed story; however, when he was pressed by Mr Rhodri Davies QC for News International, he said: But I have to say yet again, that was not typical, nothing like typical of the cases that we were seeing

CLAIM sentence:   Mr Thomas expressed the opinion that the evidence obtained as part of Operation Motorman did not come near to being characterised as being in the public interest

CLAIM sentence:  I can add that no example of a search for the weekend telephone number of a recently resigned minister has been shown to me

CLAIM sentence:  Even assuming a journalist needed to contact the subject of a story, it is difficult to imagine why he or she should need to know the telephone details of the family and friends of the target

CLAIM sentence:  The case against a journalist instructing Mr Whittamore to obtain the relevant information is slightly different because, in order to establish guilt under s, the prosecution would have to prove to the criminal standard that the journalist in question either knowingly or recklessly obtained or disclosed personal data or the information contained in personal data, s()(a), or procured the disclosure to another person of the information contained in personal data, s()(b)

CLAIM sentence:  The Information Commissioner formed the view that the material obtained during the course of Operation Motorman was of sufficient quality and quantity to bring criminal proceedings against the private detective Mr Whittamore and his associates involved in the blagging and obtaining of personal information

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence discovered by the MPS had highlighted the unauthorised supply of information from the PNC by a civilian police employee, and the CPS charged four individuals; namely Steve Whittamore, John Boyall, Alan King and Paul Marshall with corruption offences

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Whittamore and Mr Boyall pleaded guilty to offences under s of the DPA

CLAIM sentence:  First, Paul Marshall had already been given a conditional discharge at an earlier trial in respect of unrelated offences, his mitigation being that he was seriously ill; in the courts view, Mr Marshall could not now be given a higher sentence for a less serious offence, and his co-defendants could not be treated less leniently either

CLAIM sentence:  Second, the personal circumstances of each of the defendants (as argued before the judge) meant that the court considered that it could not impose a fine

CLAIM sentence:  Separate proceedings under s of the DPA had been commenced by the ICO against Mr Whittamore and five other private investigators

CLAIM sentence:  However, the proceedings were withdrawn when the CPS prosecutions resulted in a sentence of a conditional discharge

CLAIM sentence:  In  the then Information Commissioner, Mr Thomas, published two Parliamentary reports documenting the widespread trade in confidential personal information

CLAIM sentence:  What Price Privacy? identified three newspaper articles in The Guardian, The Sunday Telegraph and The Times, written in the period between September  and January , which related to the obtaining of confidential information by private detectives and the sale of confidential information from government departments, namely the Inland Revenue, to outside agencies

CLAIM sentence:  The report explained that: documents seized during Operation Motorman and in other investigations have allowed the ICO to build up a clear picture of how the market in unlawful personal data operates

CLAIM sentence:  The report analysed the information seized at Mr Whittamores premises as falling into two categories of documentation

CLAIM sentence:  The primary documentation consisted of correspondence (reports, invoices, settlements of bills) between Mr Whittamore and many national newspapers and magazines, identifying the individual journalist seeking the information

CLAIM sentence:   These reports were laid pursuant to s() of the DPA

CLAIM sentence:  Details of the mothers telephone calls and cars owned appeared in Mr Whittamores ledgers and records of financial transactions

CLAIM sentence:  The total sum paid by newspapers for the items of information supplied in Operation Motorman is estimated to be between , and ,

CLAIM sentence:  This gives an indication that the supply of personal information was, for those involved, a lucrative business

CLAIM sentence:  The table sets out a breakdown of the extent to which individual newspapers and magazines were implicated in the evidence produced by Operation Motorman and, in particular, the number of journalists employed by each newspaper or magazine which was identified as having requested the supply of personal information

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Thomas emphasised that it was not being said that every single transaction identified was an offence committed by a journalist, but rather that journalists were significant customers of information which appeared to have been obtained illegally

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Thomas also expressed the view that it was likely that journalists were committing an offence

CLAIM sentence:  First, whilst the journalists engaged in buying personal information supplied through a private investigator were employed by a range of titles, including tabloid newspapers, broadsheet newspapers and magazines, there is significant variation in the extent to which journalists and titles engaged in the purchase of personal information from Mr Whittamore

CLAIM sentence:  For example,  journalists from the Daily Mail sought the supply of personal information on  occasions, whereas by contrast one journalist from The Sunday Times sought the supply of personal information on four occasions

CLAIM sentence:  For the purposes of responding to a request by Lord Ashcroft under the Freedom of Information Act , ICO investigation officers and an in-house lawyer analysed the source material collated as part of Operation Motorman

CLAIM sentence:  They documented some , transactions, or individual requests for information made of Mr Whittamore

CLAIM sentence:  A further , requests represented occupancy searches and are thought to have been information obtained from telephone service providers

CLAIM sentence:  The first category of transactions only was included with the Parliamentary Reports

CLAIM sentence:  Overall, it is not surprising that the Core Participants made the concessions recorded under paragraph 

CLAIM sentence:  As will become apparent, the extent to which Mr Whittamores services continued to be used by some titles after his conviction is even more revealing

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Fifth-Witness-Statement-of-Richard- Thomas-CBE

CLAIM sentence:  Introduction This Inquiry was ultimately directed because of the wide scale public revulsion at the reported conduct of one or more journalists from the News of the World (NoTW) in intercepting messages left on the mobile telephone of Milly Dowler: this type of interception has been referred to colloquially as phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  This part of the Report, therefore deals with a wide range of issues including, in relation to Operation Caryatid: E (b) (a) whether the nature of the relationship between the police and the media explains why the police did not pursue journalists other than Clive Goodman in  and why the investigation was not re-opened following expressed concerns in  and ; the nature and extent of any relationship between News International (NI) and senior officers who were or became involved in this operation and the extent (if at all) to which any relationship influenced directly or indirectly the way in which operational decisions were approached; in the event that investigating officers or those with an operational role in connection with the investigation did not themselves have any relevant relationship, whether knowledge or understanding of the existence of such a relationship between NI and their superiors was taken into account when they approached decisions; and; in order to make recommendations as to the future, the approach and response to the investigation of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the prosecuting authorities more generally

CLAIM sentence:  The Head of the Royalty Protection Department, Commander Loughborough, approached Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Specialist Operations) Peter Clarke (now retired) who was the head of the anti-terrorism branch of the MPS (then known as SO)

CLAIM sentence:  Given the potential threat to the safety of members of the Royal Family and the sensitivities surrounding them, Mr Clarke decided that SO would investigate the matter and would do so covertly (in  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke sought to safeguard the secrecy of the investigation by ensuring only very few officers were aware of it

CLAIM sentence:  He explained that the need for operational security was one of the factors that weighed in his mind when deciding to keep the investigation within SO, where the investigators were developed vetted

CLAIM sentence:  He set its parameters and strategy and was answerable to the Assistant Commissioner (Specialist Operations), Andy Hayman

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman has described himself as accountable for the investigation but not responsible for day-to-day decision-making, nor personally involved in formulating strategy

CLAIM sentence:  The Deputy Commissioner, at the time, Sir Paul Stephenson, played no apparent role in any relevant events in /

CLAIM sentence:  The then Commissioner, Lord Blair, said that his knowledge of the entire investigation was limited to short briefings imparted in a few minutes on very few occasions  Lord Blair explained that if those involved had not been members of the Royal Family, for whose security he had ultimate responsibility, he would not have expected to have been informed of the case at all

CLAIM sentence:  The Senior Investigating Officer (SIO), Detective Superintendent Philip Williams (now Detective Chief Superintendent (DCS) Williams), was responsible for implementing the strategy set by Mr Clarke, for the daily conduct of the investigation and for providing him with regular personal briefings

CLAIM sentence:  Otherwise, DCS Williams reported to Mr Clarke through his senior officers, DCS Tim White and Commander John McDowell

CLAIM sentence:  By May , Commander McDowell was succeeded by Commander Loughborough

CLAIM sentence:  From  April , the Investigating Officer (IO) was Detective Chief Inspector Keith Surtees (now DCS Surtees)

CLAIM sentence:  His role was to deliver the strategy by deciding and putting into effect the tactics

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees also personally briefed Mr Clarke and undertook the role of SIO when DCS Williams was absent

CLAIM sentence:  Towards the end of April , Detective Sergeant Maberly (now a Detective Inspector or DI) was appointed the case officer for Operation Caryatid and worked with Detective Constable Robert Green (now a Detective Sergeant)

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Lord-Blair

CLAIM sentence:  Neither Mr Hayman nor Mr Clarke read the decision log or case reviews

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke explained that he would not have expected to read them but was briefed orally throughout the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke was involved in the overall review of the decisions made and how the investigation was progressing

CLAIM sentence:  They are referred to in general terms only with some parts quoted in order to tell the full story

CLAIM sentence:  The reason is that to publish them in full at this time might prejudice criminal investigations and future trials

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke defined the parameters of Operation Caryatid as follows: to investigate the unauthorised interception of voicemail messages in the Royal Household; to prosecute those responsible if possible; and to take all necessary steps to prevent this type of abuse of the telephone system in the future

CLAIM sentence:  The first step taken by DCS Williams was to establish whether or not a third party had been accessing the voicemail messages of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey without their permission

CLAIM sentence:  At that stage Vodafone and O, the respective service providers, maintained that they had not appreciated that it was possible to listen to another persons voicemail messages without their knowledge or permission

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence of DCS Williams was that it was only due to the tenacity of DI Kevin Southworth (now Detective Superintendent Southworth) who worked with Vodafone and their engineers that the police discovered how mobile phone voicemail systems worked

CLAIM sentence:  It was the case, apparently, that the service providers had limited ability to establish precisely what was  p, lines -, Mark Maberly, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  By  January , with the assistance of Vodafones engineers, the police had established that a number of outside or potential rogue numbers had been calling in to Mr Lowther- Pinkertons voicemail box, using his unique voicemail access number

CLAIM sentence:  One of those rogue numbers was traced to Mr Goodmans home address

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams immediately recognised the possible implications of this apparent vulnerability in voicemail systems and recorded in the decision log that they could be quite far reaching among the mobile phone service providers

CLAIM sentence:  The police therefore obtained Mr Goodmans telephone records (or outgoing call data) in order to ascertain whom he was calling

CLAIM sentence:  On  March  there was a case review meeting involving Mr Clarke, DCS Williams, DCS White and DCI Paul Greenwood

CLAIM sentence:  It was decided at that meeting that the lines of enquiry would remain focussed predominantly on Mr Lowther-Pinkertons voicemail box and the link to Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  As regards Mr Goodman, the investigation was to focus on establishing whether or not he was attempting to access other voicemail accounts and whether or not his actions were limited to the Royal Household

CLAIM sentence: pdf; Vodafone referred to voicemail telephone numbers as unique voicemail numbers (UVNs) whilst O referred to them as direct dial numbers (DDNs)

CLAIM sentence:  He recorded that following an analysis of the outgoing call data from Mr Goodmans home phone number, five to six potential victims, all within the Royal Household, had been identified

CLAIM sentence:  The police had ascertained that Mr Goodman had been making a significant number of phone calls to Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and these other members of the Royal Household over a sustained period of time

CLAIM sentence:  In the review, DCS Williams indicated that guidance would be sought from the CPS in relation to the two main offences that he had identified as arising from Mr Goodmans actions

CLAIM sentence: , provide an exposition of the weight of the terrorism investigations which were over-stretching the resources of S and had required Mr Clarke to borrow resources not only from other departments within the MPS but other police forces  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xc extending the circle of knowledge concerning what is still a highly sensitive covert enquiry runs the risk of the nature of the enquiry becoming more publicly known and possibly alerting suspect(s), thereby preventing the opportunity for offenders to be brought to justice and/or other appropriate security and commercial interests to be fully considered once the full facts are known

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams recorded in the decision log that he had raised with Mr Clarke, Commander McDowell and DCS White his concern about continuing with the investigation given the pressure on resources: Im raising to my senior management that if we take this forward to a final prosecution and it gets played out in court, given the fact that we are under huge, huge pressure in terms of our counter-terrorism operations, how is it right that the anti-terrorist branch is dedicated [sic] investigating resources to something that actually is not terrorism? Equally, there were valid arguments for why we should retain it

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams explained the stage the investigation had reached as follows: My parameters remained in terms of keeping the investigation focused on the primary victims supported by an uplift in resourcing to enable the evidential gathering phase to begin in earnest

CLAIM sentence:  Unless the evidence is capable of showing all of the details we discussed (length of original message, length of call to recipients voicemail etc) it is unlikely that we could proceed with the technical evidence alone

CLAIM sentence:  At this stage, there was no evidence in the hands of the police that any NoTW journalist (other than Mr Goodman) was implicated in voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  All have said that the issue of voicemail interception (still in its covert phase) was not discussed on that occasion, and as Mr Garnham QC was able to develop in argument, an examination of the chronology of decision making within the MPS at this point demonstrates that nothing discussed at that dinner could have resulted in any favour shown to NI

CLAIM sentence:  The story moves on to  May  when DCS Williams recorded in an Enquiry Update that the police had discovered another potential suspect, a Paul Williams (which transpired to be an alias used by Mr Mulcaire)

CLAIM sentence:  In the update DCS Williams set out three options to be considered by the senior management

CLAIM sentence:  Option one was that there be no further investigation with the intention of prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  He recommended the third option over the short-term, and provided a very perceptive rationale in this way: we have discovered a vulnerability that exists within the mobile telephone industry whereby unscrupulous people could intrude upon the privacy of the vast majority of  pp-, Neil Garnham QC, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  I suspect that the media world may well be aware of this vulnerability and there may well be a host of people using this vulnerability for journalistic purposes

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams recorded at the end of the update that its contents had been briefed to DCS White and Commander Loughborough and that he had been advised that the enquiry would remain within SO for the time being

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams decided to mount what he termed a sting operation (although this is a misnomer because the operation did not involve deception) which amounted to allocating a test period over around three weeks in May and June  during which the relevant activity on the mobile phones of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey would be monitored

CLAIM sentence:  During this test, Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey were asked to retrieve their voicemail messages only at set times twice in every  hour period

CLAIM sentence:  Part of the strategy for the operation was to ascertain whether the service providers had the software capability to detect both the fact that a message had been left and the retrieval of unheard messages by one of the rogue numbers

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly explained that Vampire data was an engineering or diagnostic tool used by Vodafone to monitor how its systems were running, including its voicemail systems

CLAIM sentence:  Where Vampire data was not available, the fact that a voicemail message had been accessed had to be deduced from the length of the incoming call to the voicemail box

CLAIM sentence:  The telephone expert for the prosecution, David Bristowe, explained that the call would need to be at least  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore, where a call was at least  to  seconds in length, it could be inferred that the caller had listened to a voicemail message

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose was to prove that the telephone was in Mr Goodmans hand at the time of any relevant calls from that number into the voicemail systems being monitored

CLAIM sentence:  This was highly significant because these potential victims were not members of the Royal Household and therefore would not ostensibly have been of any interest to Mr Goodman (although the NoTW was later to argue that Mr Goodman had a wider remit than the Royal Household)

CLAIM sentence:  In the briefing Ms Dowd explained the legal and technical issues, and stated: in addition to Goodman, another potential suspect has been identified as accessing the UVMs [sic] on a number of occasions and inquiries continue in relation to him

CLAIM sentence:  I am told that in the media world he is widely suspected of being able to access mobiles A vast number of UVMs belonging to high profile individuals (politicians and celebrities) have been identified as being accessed without authority these may be the subject of a wider investigation in due course

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Macdonald QC asked to be kept closely informed

CLAIM sentence:  As the briefing given by Ms Dowd to the DPP indicated, the police had by then ascertained that one of the rogue numbers accessing the voicemail boxes of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey belonged to Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees identified the possibility that Mr Mulcaire and Paul Williams were one and the same person

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke decided to keep the investigation within the anti-terrorist branch and not to widen the original parameters of the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke described his thinking as follows: As the investigation progressed it became clear that there may have been many other people being targeted by whoever was responsible for the interception, and there was potential for the investigation to become much wider

CLAIM sentence:  I took the decision that this was not appropriate for a number of reasons

CLAIM sentence:  In coming to the decision that the parameters of the investigation had to remain tightly drawn it was obvious to me that a wider investigation would inevitably take much longer to complete

CLAIM sentence:  First, that the investigation would be compromised and evidence lost and second, that the much wider range of people who we were learning were becoming the victims of this activity would continue to be victimised while the investigation took its course

CLAIM sentence:  This would probably go on for many months and to my mind this would be unacceptable

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke rejected the option of informing the victims, in confidence

CLAIM sentence:  This was to enable the investigation to continue: It was not feasible to notify victims and continue with a wide ranging covert investigation, and if we had done so, it is inconceivable that the fact that there was an enquiry into this matter would not have leaked, thereby compromising the investigation and leading to the potential loss of evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke agreed that this decision not to widen the parameters of the investigation was probably made on or shortly after  May  when DCS Surtees briefed him on the potential breadth of the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, the police strategy was to continue concentrating on arresting and prosecuting Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and not (in the  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of- Morning-Hearing--March-

CLAIM sentence:  On  June , DCS Williams prepared a further written update

CLAIM sentence:  He recorded that through an analysis of the Vodafone Vampire data gathered during what he termed the sting operation, the police had identified two voicemail interceptions in the narrow sense by Mr Goodman and two by a phone number which was subsequently attributed to Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Over that period the number of operations has increased from numbers in the s to today at tasking where we have reached  active operations with a number of them posing significant life threatening risks

CLAIM sentence:  Today again at tasking, as in previous weeks, there were requests for additional resource with there no longer being any spare capacity

CLAIM sentence:  Meanwhile, the service providers continued to identify previously undiscovered potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  The decision not to widen the investigation was, however, maintained

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  DCS Surtees noted in the decision log that he was aware that there were potentially numerous victims, at the hands of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire or others, but that identifying all those victims would be hugely time consuming

CLAIM sentence:  The police informed the CPS that the telephone evidence indicated that: (a) between  January  and  April  Mr Goodmans landline had called the unique voicemail access numbers of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey  times and  times respectively; (b) between  February  and  May  a landline located in the offices of NI had (c) (d) called Ms Aspreys unique voicemail access number; in May  a landline number registered to an office leased by Mr Mulcaire had called the unique voicemail access numbers of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey five times and  times respectively; and the number relating to Mr Mulcaires office premises had called Mr Goodmans mobile phone a number of times

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Macdonald agreed that the briefing was premised on the narrow interpretation of s of RIPA

CLAIM sentence:  However, Ms Dowd expressed the view that offences of conspiracy between Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire to commit s of RIPA and s of CMA offences may better reflect the alleged criminality involved and enable a more comprehensive case to be presented

CLAIM sentence:  She advised that the case against Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, at that stage limited to the Royal Household interceptions, was cogent and presentable and could proceed without the need to delve into the content of any messages left and/or retrieved

CLAIM sentence:  He noted that: there may well be a much wider range of victims and indeed I suspect that Mulcaire could well be someone whose business it is to secure access to information concerning a whole range of VIPs

CLAIM sentence:  Identifying the options, again he included: extend[ing] the investigation to include the full extent of this potential criminality which would help to establish the seriousness of what we are facing

CLAIM sentence:  but he went on: However, to do this effectively the enquiry would probably have to remain covert, which would leave my known and unknown victims vulnerable over a much greater period of time

CLAIM sentence:  Because of this, DCS Williams was of the view that Operation Caryatid should remain limited to victims within the Royal Household but that Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire should be arrested as soon as possible in order to curtail the exposure of the victims to voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  [whereas] Once executive action is taken then all parties can be briefed re the security issues and the phone companies can start to put in appropriate security measures and brief/reassure their customers all of which will reduce public/personal harm 

CLAIM sentence:  His list included the following: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) that the support of the Royal Household was strongly based on the confidence it had in SO; that the relationships formed between SO and the service providers were crucial to a successful prosecution; the importance of continuity of the investigation; that delays would be caused by transferring the investigation to another department because a new SIO would need to review the case and may have resource constraints that might further delay the operation

CLAIM sentence:  the current teams intimate knowledge of the case, which could not realistically be picked up in the same detail by a new team

CLAIM sentence:   Operation Caryatid Update as of Thursday  July  (not published)  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xc

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams sought strategic guidance on this approach from Mr Clarke, who endorsed his view

CLAIM sentence:  He then went on leave until  August  so it fell to DCS Surtees to deal with information received on  July  to the effect that Mr Mulcaire had accessed the voicemail of Tessa Jowell, then a cabinet minister

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry agreed during his evidence that the advice he gave was essentially that, first, there was evidence in respect of four main substantive offences which established in any event that the interception had taken place before the intended recipient had accessed the voicemail message concerned; and second, that in relation to the conspiracy charge, the issues about whether or not there needed to be an unopened envelope would not arise

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry explained in his evidence that he also advised against charging Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman with CMA offences because asking a jury to deal with those allegations together with s of RIPA would be confusing; furthermore, s of RIPA more accurately reflected the conduct concerned

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry also advised as to the possibility of obtaining a warrant under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act  (PACE) and the attendant difficulties which would arise in relation to journalistic material

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcI think its more that weve got more information/evidence coming from the telephone companies to talk about access to DDNs and the sequencing which were concentrating on as opposed to more suspects

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst each, as their roles required, will have interacted with individuals from NI at certain times during their careers, they did not form social relationships

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke gave evidence as to his level of interaction with individuals from NI, which, in spite of his senior position and high-profile role, was extremely limited

CLAIM sentence:  At the meeting, they were unexpectedly (at least to Mr Clarke) joined by Rupert Murdoch

CLAIM sentence:  The only known relationship was with Mr Clarkes senior officer, Mr Hayman, and the occasions in respect of which there is evidence of contact with NI in the relevant period will be clear; there is no basis for suggesting that Mr Hayman was any more than peripherally involved in the investigation; to such extent as he was involved in any way, it was solely because of his responsibilities for overall command of Mr Clarkes team

CLAIM sentence:  Neither do I believe that Mr Clarke or any of the other officers were or would have been affected by any such relationship

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence of Mr Hayman is that he allocated the investigation to Mr Clarke, asked him to devise an investigation strategy and an operation, and let him get on with it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman only expected Mr Clarke to refer to him if Mr Clarke considered there was something that Mr Hayman needed to brief up to the Commissioner or if Mr Clarke had insufficient resources

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman stressed that he was not involved in the detail of Operation Caryatid and stated that his degree of detachment was demonstrated by the fact that he did not know when the arrests or searches were going to take place

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman told the Inquiry that he could count on one hand the number of times he and Mr Clarke spoke about the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke, in general agreement with the extent to which Mr Hayman had contact with him on this issue said that he personally would have briefed Mr Hayman probably not very often

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke could not remember specifically which issues he discussed with Mr Hayman except  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcthat he certainly briefed Mr Hayman at the outset when it was discovered that Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire appeared to be responsible and probably in the run-up to the arrest phase

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear, therefore, that Mr Hayman did not make any operational decisions and did not influence relevant decision-making, save to the extent that he did not disagree with any of the decisions made by Mr Clarke

CLAIM sentence:  Elaborating on the reasons for these conclusions, it is clear that during the pre-arrest phase of the investigation DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and, indeed, Mr Clarke were aware that there could be a wide range of other victims but that the priority which needed to be given to counter terrorism, the need for secrecy and the belief that arresting Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire would send out the strongest signal and bring this criminality to an end all militated against expansion

CLAIM sentence:  Attempts were also made to search the offices of NI in Wapping although to minimise the risk of encountering journalistic material, the CPS had advised that the search of those premises should be confined to Mr Goodmans desk and the finance offices

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly explained that the police intended to seize records relating to financial payments to Mr Mulcaire (including documents recording the dates of such payments, the reasons for the payments and those authorising the payments) and plans or directories relating to the locations of telephone extensions within the offices

CLAIM sentence:  It is significant and a matter of regret that the plans for the search were substantially thwarted

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees described how the searching officers were obstructed by NI personnel: There was some real difficulty in conducting the search at News International

CLAIM sentence:  There were I think four of my officers who actually got into the premises before News International barred the rest of my officers from going into News International

CLAIM sentence:  A number of night or news editors challenged the officers around the illegality of their entry into News International

CLAIM sentence:  On being informed of the level of obstruction, DCS Surtees, who was not present at the search, instructed the small team to search Mr Goodmans desk only and leave the premises with whatever they had recovered

CLAIM sentence:  The search of Mr Mulcaires home and business premises was very much more successful: the police seized some , pages of papers

CLAIM sentence:  These papers have been referred to in various ways including as Mulcaires notebook and the Mulcaire archive and, in part, consisted of lists of names, with addresses, landline and mobile phone numbers; in some cases, there were unique voicemail access numbers and pin numbers along with contact details for the network service provider

CLAIM sentence:  In a number of cases in respect of which Mr Goodman was later prosecuted, that name or corner name (as it has since been termed) was Clive

CLAIM sentence:  This email (dated  June ) was apparently sent by Ross Hindley at the NoTW, to Mr Mulcaire, and is entitled Transcript for Neville: Wednesday, June  

CLAIM sentence:  Then, set out in the body of the email is the text of  voicemail messages left for, or received by, Gordon Taylor

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to this mountain of paper, the police also seized from Mr Mulcaire audio cassettes, CD roms, white boards showing pin numbers, security codes and bank details of potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  There was also a contract between Mr Mulcaire and the NoTW according to which Mr Mulcaire was to provide a research and information service to the newspaper and undertook to carry out all research and information assignments requested

CLAIM sentence:  Suffice to say that he was paid a weekly retainer amounting to no less than , per week

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the weekly retainer he also received other payments, typically of , which appear to have been linked to work on specific stories

CLAIM sentence:  On  and  August  Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman were separately interviewed by junior rank detectives

CLAIM sentence:  At this stage, however, what is of interest is not what they might have said but the questions themselves for although, at that stage, the police would only have been able to undertake a cursory examination of the documents seized, they indicate just how much the police knew or appreciated about the likely extent of Mr Mulcaires activities and, at least to some extent, who his victims were

CLAIM sentence:  During the interviews of Mr Mulcaire on  August , the interviewing officers referred to Abi Titmuss, and various sports people, offenders and members of the Royal Family (whose names have been redacted)

CLAIM sentence:  Among the allegations put to Mr Mulcaire, Detective Constable Gallagher asked the following questions: Im gonna cross reference something in this document

CLAIM sentence:  Theres a reference to Tessa Jowell and then in brackets, sorry circled above it says MP, gives a telephone number DDMI, PIN number

CLAIM sentence:  [Redacted] is crossed out David Mills and then it says [redacted], gives an account number and network Voda

CLAIM sentence:  On the extent of the work that Mr Mulcaire was performing for the paper, DC Gallagher asked the following: Okay

CLAIM sentence:  This suggests that you do have a contract, a long term contract with the News of the World and that would account for you being paid up to , a week by them

CLAIM sentence:  Can you recall in the last interview, yeah, I put it to you that you were on a retainer by News of the World to do research for them

CLAIM sentence:  Theyre asking you to do research for them and youre providing them with information and on top of that, when you get a good one, then you have a separate contract for that particular job and youre in the business of delving into peoples personal lives inappropriately, breaking the law to intercept telecommunications and thats part and parcel of what you do

CLAIM sentence:  DC Green returned to the issue on a later occasion and asked the following question: Im asking you to account for the fact that this invoice shows that you have been paid for what would appear to be work in and around a person called Jowell who I believe to be Tessa Jowell who weve outlined in other documents

CLAIM sentence:  Revealing a suspicion that Mr Mulcaire had been working for one or more NI journalists other than Mr Goodman, DC Green also put the following to him: I have no doubt, this simply goes back and there is evidence there that you have been in the employee [sic] of News International for several years and youve been working with Mr Goodman most recently

CLAIM sentence:  In an entry in the decision log dated  August , DCS Surtees gave a further indication of what the police were able to ascertain within days of seizing the documentation from Mr Mulcaire and which revealed his suspicions that Mr Mulcaires work was centred on obtaining access to voicemail messages: Having reviewed the material seized at the address searches it is clear that there is a wealth of sensitive documents relating to hundreds of individuals including Royal Household, Members of Parliament, Sports stars, Military Police, Celebrities and journalists

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear from the documents Recovered from the searches conducted that Mulcaire has been engaged in sustained (years) period of research on behalf of News International, this assumption is based on the fact that News International have for a number of years paid substantial cash payments to his bank accounts

CLAIM sentence:  The documents are a collection of handwritten sheets that show research work in various levels of completion

CLAIM sentence:  In many there is simply a name of a celebrity or well known public figure these develop into sheets detailing home addresses, business addresses, telephone numbers, DDNs, account numbers, passwords, pin numbers and scribblings of private information

CLAIM sentence:  With the identification and notification of potential victims in mind, DCS Surtees continued as follows in the decision log: To establish a full picture as to whether individuals have been intercepted or the amount of times they have been intercepted all of the airtime providers will need to search their database to give us those details

CLAIM sentence:  Once all of this work is complete then I will discuss the issue of how we will notify those victims

CLAIM sentence:  Where we have a telephone number and a DDN I have asked for the telephone data to be cross referenced to ascertain whether possible interceptions have taken place

CLAIM sentence:  The blue book also identified those who had potentially received the product of Mr Mulcaires work and was supplemented over the following weeks with various pieces of information, including information supplied by the telephone companies

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees explained that where Mr Mulcaire had recorded the unique voicemail access number for a particular voicemail box, the relevant mobile phone company was asked whether the number had been dialled by numbers which could be attributed to Clive Goodman or Glenn Mulcaire, that is, the suspect numbers

CLAIM sentence:  The precise timing is not clear, but around the same time (and in line with the decision recorded on  August ), the police asked all five of the UK mobile phone service providers to identify calls by these suspect numbers, to  ibid  p, lines -, Keith Surtees, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  To the suspect numbers was added a hub (or general) phone number at the NoTW which the police had also identified was being used to access voicemail boxes

CLAIM sentence:  In that letter they claimed that the NoTW had retained the services of Mr Mulcaires company, Nine Consultancy, for a number of years, but that the activities currently the subject of charges were the result of a separate arrangement between Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and were undertaken and paid for outwith this official arrangement with the newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  Burton Copeland claimed that at the end of October  Mr Goodman introduced a supposed confidential source named Alexander who was given cash payments

CLAIM sentence:  They enclosed the records of payments made to Alexander and a corresponding schedule entitled Cash paid by News International (through Goodman) to Glenn Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  The cash payments totalled ,

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perrys recollection is that, at that stage, he and Mr Mably did not have all the papers subsequently used at the Crown Court

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has seen notes of this conference prepared by DCS Williams and also those of Mr Perry and Mr Mably

CLAIM sentence:  In essence, the police officers explained to counsel that the review of the seized material had demonstrated the existence of approximately  targets of interception although the nature and quality of the evidence in relation to each had not been established

CLAIM sentence:  In a short note produced on  July , nearly three years later, Mr Perry and Mr Mably recorded the following: We did enquire of the police at the conference whether there was any evidence that the editor of the News of the World was involved in the Goodman-Mulcaire offences

CLAIM sentence:  We were told that there was not (and we never saw such evidence)

CLAIM sentence:  Again we were told that there was not (and we never saw any such evidence)

CLAIM sentence:  Notwithstanding the apparent certainty of counsels recollection as expressed in their note, the evidence given by Mr Perry was slightly less emphatic as regards the specificity of his questions: I dont think I would like to say that I necessarily expressed it in precisely those terms, but I was concerned to discover whether this went further than just the particular individuals with which we were concerned and I think I was conscious in my own mind that the question had to be whether it was journalists to the extent of the editor

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry clarified during his evidence that his question was directed at ascertaining whether there was evidence that would support charges against other individuals rather than understanding simply what suspicions the police might have had

CLAIM sentence:  Recognising that many cases are built on circumstantial or inferential evidence, Mr Perry said: But it depends on the combination of circumstances and the strength of any evidence, but certainly in the context of looking at the material that we had in this case and the evidence available to us, I certainly dont think I saw anything that would have enabled me to present a case in any on the basis of any inference or circumstantial evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry also made it clear that he had not seen any evidence that other individuals had been involved, but that he was basing his question on his own knowledge and experience of journalists and newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  In answer to his direct question, Mr Perry said: We were informed that there was no such evidence

CLAIM sentence:  It seems overwhelmingly likely both that DCS Williams was the officer who answered Mr Perrys question (neither DCS Surtees nor DI Maberly were at the conference) and that Mr Perrys recollection of the answer given was accurate

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer declined to comment on this segment of DCS Williams note

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry explained that there were two issues relating to the question of a production order: the first was whether there was any basis for obtaining evidence generally by way of a production order, and the second was whether a production order should be sought to obtain evidence of payments made by Mr Goodman to Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry emphasised that he did not think that the minds of anyone were closed at that stage and it is certainly accurate that, following the conference, Mr Mably did, in fact, draft an application for a production order

CLAIM sentence:  I do not believe that DCS Williams sought to downplay the number of victims, as has been suggested, still less that he misled counsel in any respect

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that DCS Williams told counsel that there was no evidence that journalists other than Mr Goodman were involved, when in reality there was inferential and circumstantial evidence, but this was in the context of the common understanding that counsel was enquiring into whether there was sufficient evidence to charge any further suspects

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams did not hide from counsel his suspicions that others were involved, on the contrary, they were openly discussed: he sought advice from counsel on whether a production order could be obtained in order to secure evidence to substantiate those suspicions

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams was plainly open to pursuing investigative avenues with a view to supporting the hypothesis that others were involved

CLAIM sentence:  It would be unfair to suggest that, in some way, he was setting out to restrict the investigation and avoid casting the net beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, no evidence was concealed

CLAIM sentence:  Counsel were given a copy of the blue book; further, albeit for the specific and limited purpose of reviewing the unused material, Mr Mably was given access to all the documents seized, including all the Mulcaire papers

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of any review of unused material (conducted in this case by junior counsel, Mr Mably) is not to look for evidence that might implicate others (in this case, others at NI or elsewhere), but to fulfil the disclosure obligations imposed on the prosecution by the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act  (CPIA)

CLAIM sentence:  S (Initial duty of prosecutor to disclose) provides that: The prosecutor must (a) disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed to the accused and which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for the prosecution against the accused or of assisting the case for the accused, or (b) give to the accused a written statement that there is no material of a description mentioned in paragraph (a)  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcgiven, and with what emphasis

CLAIM sentence:  That said, Mr Perry gave clear evidence to the effect that he did not advise that the narrow view of the law was correct

CLAIM sentence:  In short:  well, Im confident that that was not the approach that we took because it wouldnt be consistent with the terms of the indictment that was originally settled, and I think that the view that Mr Mably and I took was that what Lord Woolf had said in the Ipswich Crown Court case certainly provided an arguable basis for someone to contend that the narrow view was correct, but we thought that we should proceed on the broader view, and if the point were taken against us, we could meet it in a number of ways, because it was about making sure that we didnt lose the case overall, and we could meet it in a number of ways [a]nd in any event, the conspiracy charge could outflank any such argument

CLAIM sentence:  So it came about that, in due course, counts  to  of the indictment, which alleged substantive offences under RIPA solely against Mr Mulcaire, were drafted by counsel

CLAIM sentence:  As Mr Perry explained in evidence, he could not possibly have taken the narrow interpretation of the law to be correct since, in relation to counts  to  there was neither evidence nor basis for saying that the message had been listened to by an interceptor before it had been heard by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  Further, Mr Perry did not advise the police to obtain Vampire data in relation to counts  to 

CLAIM sentence:  Put simply, Mr Perry is correct

CLAIM sentence:  It is simply inconceivable that he (or any counsel instructed by the Crown to prosecute allegations of crime) would have prepared an indictment on the premise of a legal interpretation which they knew to be incorrect

CLAIM sentence:  I have no doubt that Mr Perry gave the advice in the terms summarised by him in his evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Regardless of the extent to which both Mr Perry advised clearly and the advice was properly understood, following this conference, the police made no attempt to obtain technical evidence in relation to what became counts  to  which would have enabled the case to be proved on the narrow view of the law

CLAIM sentence:  Nor is there any contemporaneous evidence to show that counsels advice caused surprise or consternation in the police camp

CLAIM sentence:  This evidence contradicts what Mr Perry recorded in his advice dated  July  which said in terms that it was necessary to prove that the message was intercepted before it was accessed by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  To the suggestion that this might have been the advice he gave in  Mr Perry said that: if I did in this document give the impression that the narrow view had been adopted then that is incorrect p, lines -, David Perry QC, http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-- April-

CLAIM sentence:  The reason why Mr Perry gave different advice is considered at paras 

CLAIM sentence:  The police wished to contend for a substantial benefit figure based on the monthly retainer on the basis that it was part and parcel of Mr Mulcaires criminal enterprise

CLAIM sentence:  However, given NIs claim, through Burton Copeland, that the monthly retainer paid to Mr Mulcaire did not relate to the matters that were the subject of charges, Mr Perry advised that the confiscation proceedings should focus on the cash payments, which amounted to ,

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry explained that the short point was that if Mr Mulcaire was doing legitimate work it was difficult to argue that it was as a result of or in connection with the offending

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry agreed that it was his decision that this was the appropriate approach to take

CLAIM sentence:  It is convenient to state here that ultimately the Crown Court made a confiscation order for ,

CLAIM sentence:  Before passing from the information placed before Mr Perry and the advice that he gave, it is appropriate to refer to the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  When giving evidence, Mr Perry was asked whether or not he saw this email at this conference or at any stage before  January  (when Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were sentenced)

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry said in evidence that he did not have any recollection of seeing it, and he did not shift his ground when shown a note of a much later conference on  October  which suggested that he saw this email after the case papers relating to Mr Gordon Taylor had been prepared for trial

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that the email formed part of the unused material but Mr Perry was not asked to examine that material and would not have been expected to do so absent specific instruction

CLAIM sentence:  Although it may not advance the issue very far, I conclude that Mr Perry probably did not see the for Neville email earlier than his recollection

CLAIM sentence:  I was telephoned again by the police to be told that a prosecution was going to be brought against Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  I cant remember the precise word that I used, but it was essentially an offer of any assistance with the inquiry, and was told very clearly that I wouldnt be needed as a witness because they had witnesses from the royal household who would support the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  In the meantime, in response to the request to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes had been called by the suspect numbers, Vodafone emailed DI Maberly, on  August , with a spreadsheet of calls made to  unique voicemail access numbers by Mr Goodmans home landline and Mr Mulcaires office landline

CLAIM sentence:  On  October , O responded to the request to identify customers whose voicemail boxes had been called by the suspect numbers by sending DI Maberly a spreadsheet setting out the number of times that the  customers concerned had been called by the suspect numbers

CLAIM sentence:  An email, dated  September , sent by Andy Coulson to Tom Crone after this meeting, which set out what Mrs Brooks had been told by the cops, has generated a number of concerns

CLAIM sentence:  On the face of the email, it appeared that the police had given Mrs Brooks details of the prosecution strategy over and above that which any other victim of crime could expect to be given and it is suggested that, in so doing, the police were improperly alerting her to the state of the investigation by the MPS, inviting her to take action internally

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the last sentence of the email (They are going to contact RW today to see if she wishes to take it further) could be interpreted as meaning that the police were asking her whether she wanted the police to take further the investigation into others within NI

CLAIM sentence:  Again, I can well understand how this second hand summary of the conversation, reduced into an email, can give the impression of collusion but, having heard DCS Williams evidence on this issue, I am satisfied that Mrs Brooks was contacted by the police because she, too, had been a victim of extensive voicemail interception (with her voicemails having been accessed up to twice a week)

CLAIM sentence:  I also accept that information was passed to Mrs Brooks not as a result of an improper relationship with the police but with a view to her making a formal complaint and consenting to being part of the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  The same email also referred to Mr Mulcaire receiving payments totalling over  million

CLAIM sentence:  In evidence, DCS Williams said that the figure of  million was not known to him or his investigation team

CLAIM sentence:  The first was on  September  when Lord Blair, with Mr Fedorcio, met Andy Coulson

CLAIM sentence:  As I have set out above, Lord Blair played no part in the decision-making process; his involvement did not go beyond receiving limited briefings from Mr Hayman and Mr Clarke

CLAIM sentence:  The second was on  p, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The investigators were keen to identify who would have used the hub phone at the NoTW that had been used hundreds of times to call the voicemail boxes of individuals not associated with the Royal Household

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly approached Vodafone who told him that he would have to get that information from the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Bristowe (the prosecutions telephone expert) advised DI Maberly that no large firm would have unaccounted for billing, because it would want to monitor the use of the phone systems by staff, to detect any abuses

CLAIM sentence:  The police therefore had an expectation that NI would be able to identify the user of the hub phone in question

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees tasked DI Maberly with writing to the NoTW for the purposes of ascertaining who would have used the hub phone and obtaining further evidence against Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman, but also to gather evidence of the involvement of other journalists or editorial staff in the conspiracy with Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  This use of the hub phone also fuelled DCS Surtees suspicion that journalists other than Mr Goodman were involved in the conspiracy  pp-, lines -, Mark Maberly, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  In that letter Burton Copeland referred to the PACE application (the application for a production order drafted by Mr Mably) and the fact that the police sought: all paid cheques, credit/debit slips, mandates, statements of accounts, inter-account and telegraphic transfers, any other vouchers in relation to the following financial accounts

CLAIM sentence:  Account numbers sort code or payment to any other bank accounts held in the name of Glenn Mulcaire, Nine Consultancy Ltd or Nine Consultancy UK Ltd and any cash payments made by or on behalf of News International or Newsgroup Newspaper to Glenn Mulcaire from  January  present [sic]

CLAIM sentence:  Those requests included: (a) A floor plan to include the locations of the telephone extensions in Mr Goodmans office; (b) Details of the phones used regularly by Mr Goodman (i

CLAIM sentence:  the phone on his desk and any other mobile phone issued to him) for the period of st December  to th August ; (d) Records of any work completed by Mr Mulcaire/Nine Consultancy for Mr Goodman or other editors/journalists

CLAIM sentence:  cit  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcThe investigation is attempting to identify all persons that may be involved including any fellow conspirators

CLAIM sentence:  Therefore we require the telephone numbers of persons called before and after relevant unlawful calls to the voice mailboxes

CLAIM sentence:  On  September  DI Maberly hand delivered a further letter to Burton Copeland which included the following: During the search of Mr Goodmans offices at News International he identified the computer used by him (situated on his desk) and a safe also used by him (situated under his desk)

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to these two items I would like to be provided with a copy of information held on computer (including any mainframe database accessed from the desktop computer) and any information held in the safe that relates to the following; Material relating to any mobile telephone numbers that may [sic] connected to the interception of voicemail accounts (e

CLAIM sentence:  written notes, data files, cassette/digital recordings etc) Evidence of contact between Mr Clive Goodman, Mr Glenn Mulcaire, Mr Paul Williams, Nine Consultancy and any others (whether directly or indirectly employed by News International) relating to the interception of voicemail(s)

CLAIM sentence:  It stated the following: Newsgroup Newspapers are anxious to provide all material reasonably required in respect of your investigation into voicemail interception offences

CLAIM sentence:  In fact, very little documentary or other material in relation to Mr Mulcaire, Nine Consultancy Ltd or Mr Goodman exists

CLAIM sentence:  This is entirely consistent with normal business practices in relation to the use of such consultants

CLAIM sentence:  No documents exist recording any work completed by Mr Mulcaire, monitoring of Mr Mulcaires return of work, reporting structures or any persons for whom Mr Mulcaire may have provided information

CLAIM sentence:  There is no floor plan

CLAIM sentence:  The telephone system installed at Newsgroup Newspapers does not provide an itemised breakdown in respect of any particular extension number Newsgroup Newspapers wishes fully to assist your investigation and does not require any formal Court Order for the provision of any material

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment this is an artificial and inapt distinction: by way of example, there must have been an internal telephone directory for the NoTW and documentation that could have led the police (perhaps through the telephone network if the records were not kept) to trace which extensions were dialling which numbers

CLAIM sentence:  Rupert Murdochs evidence was that when Mr Goodman was arrested he was told, probably by Les Hinton, then the Executive Chairman of NI, that NI was co-operating with the police

CLAIM sentence:  This raises two issues about local management at NI, its internal governance and its relationship with News Corporation

CLAIM sentence:  First, if Rupert Murdochs evidence is correct, it appears that there was a lack of full transparency between the local management at NI and senior management at News Corporation or, alternatively, a very different understanding of the meaning of the word co-operation

CLAIM sentence:  Second the approach taken by NI is far from what might be expected of a well-run corporation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke described a closing of ranks by NI and said that this was unusual for a major company where full co-operation would be the norm

CLAIM sentence:  What happened at the NoTW in relation to voicemail interception in this context is particularly informative about the culture that pertained both within the corporate and editorial operations

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , pursuant to a task set by DCS Surtees, the High Tech Crime Unit of the Directorate of Professional Standards at the MPS produced a report setting out the results of the examination of the computers and other storage media seized during the August searches

CLAIM sentence:  The examination revealed a computerised record of approximately  names, addresses, dates of birth, mobile phone numbers and additional information

CLAIM sentence:  Many of the names have been redacted to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned, but the unredacted names include: Maria, Charlotte and James Church; Max Clifford; Ashley Cole; Stephen J

CLAIM sentence:  Coogan; Cornelia Crisan; George Galloway; Ryan Giggs; James Hewitt; Ulrika Jonsson; Jude Law; Sadie Frost; Elle McPherson; Mark Oaten and Brian Paddick

CLAIM sentence:  Equally seriously, at the least, it gave rise to the possibility that police officers had been providing information to Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Mulcaire was not asked about this in interview and Mr Clarke was not made aware of it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke agreed that this was the correct way of dealing with the matter

CLAIM sentence: \t The\toutcome\tto\tthe\tprosecution The criminal proceedings The indictment brought against Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman contained the following  counts: 

CLAIM sentence:  Count : Against both, conspiracy to intercept communications contrary to s() of the Criminal Law Act ; Counts , , ,  and : Against both, interception of the voicemail messages of Helen Asprey contrary to s() of RIPA; Counts , , ,  and : Against both, interception of the voicemail messages of Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton contrary to s() of RIPA; Counts , ,  and : Against both, interception of the voicemail messages of Paddy Haverson contrary to s() of RIPA; Counts -: Against Mr Mulcaire only, interception of the voicemail messages of Max Clifford, Skylet Andrew, Graham Taylor, Simon Hughes and Elle Macpherson respectively contrary to s() of RIPA

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry explained that counts  to  were substantive allegations intended as an alternative to count  which charged the underlying criminal conspiracy; in relation to all the substantive counts, there was not necessarily the evidence available to prove that the voicemails had been listened to before their intended recipients

CLAIM sentence:  Counts  to  were individual substantive charges intended to reflect the further criminality

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , at the Plea and Case Management hearing conducted at the Central Criminal Court, Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire pleaded guilty to the main counts on the indictment

CLAIM sentence:  On  January , Mr Justice Gross sentenced Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire to four and six months imprisonment respectively

CLAIM sentence:  At the sentencing hearing, during the course of his plea in mitigation, counsel for Mr Mulcaire asserted that his client was working for others at NI in relation to the interceptions which formed the basis of counts  to 

CLAIM sentence:  He said, in terms: This information would have been passed on not to Mr Goodman I stress the point but to the same organisation

CLAIM sentence:  Although this has been a matter of some debate, the point has already been made that Mr Goodman had no specific interest (perhaps with some limited exceptions) in the non- Royal material, and it is clear that the evidential links between the two men which had been present for the Royal interceptions were not available for the others

CLAIM sentence:  Yet, Mr Mulcaire must have been working for someone

CLAIM sentence:  He said: As to Counts -, you had not dealt with Goodman but with others at News International

CLAIM sentence:  Although Mr Perry rightly pointed out that the judge did not reach this conclusion as a result of any submission he had made during the course of opening the case that morning, he readily accepted that the judge was not simply relying on the submissions of Mr Mulcaires counsel but also on a bit of common sense added in

CLAIM sentence:  It is right to observe that Mr Perry added in his witness statement that: reading the transcript now does not convey the implication that other individuals were necessarily involved in unlawful interception (as opposed to receiving information)

CLAIM sentence:   This may be right, but again common sense would strongly indicate that the other individuals were aware of the source of the information they had received from Mr Mulcaire and it is difficult to postulate that Mr Mulcaire was simply offering information without being encouraged or prompted

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Justice Gross also referred in his sentencing remarks to the fact that Mr Goodman had offered by way of mitigation that he operated in an environment in which ethical lines are not clearly defined or observed

CLAIM sentence:  It is of such importance that it is worth quoting extensively from the statement made by Mr Clarke:  Throughout much of  and running into  an operation called Springbourne taught us that there was a real and immediate threat within the UK from Islamist terrorists 

CLAIM sentence:  The impact of this on other policing operations was at times severe

CLAIM sentence:  Operation Crevice alone used every single surveillance team in London and most of those from the areas around London and Mr Clarke had borrowed over , officers from other forces to support the investigation into the attacks on  July 

CLAIM sentence:  By January ,  highly experienced and specialised officers continued to be on loan for this work

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman described in evidence the terrorist threat as unprecedented

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Reid, endorsed the evidence of the police, saying that the scale of the terrorist threat and ensuing counter-terrorist operations had been well set out by others who had testified

CLAIM sentence:  He explained that the threat level of a terrorist attack during  varied only from the second highest level, Severe, to the highest, Critical, where an attack was deemed likely and imminent

CLAIM sentence:  He said the great fear of a terrorist attack at that time was superseding everything else

CLAIM sentence:  This background is critical to an understanding of the operational context in which Mr Clarke had to consider whether and, if so, to what extent the investigation should continue beyond the very targeted prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Resources, however, were not the only problem

CLAIM sentence:  The evidential issues By mid-September , the police had tried, without success, to obtain evidence from NI to support their strong suspicion that NoTW staff (other than Mr Goodman) were involved in a conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  The , pages of documents seized from Mr Mulcaire, taken together with the pattern of behaviour demonstrated by the call data obtained, created a picture of a trade craft, of someone who was building up the means unlawfully to access voicemail messages (and that in some cases he had utilised those means)

CLAIM sentence:  There was an inference that the corner names (so described because they were written in the corner of Mr Mulcaires notes) were those who had either instructed Mr Mulcaire or those who were the intended recipients of the information, or both

CLAIM sentence:  The hub phone at the NoTW had been used hundreds of times to call the voicemail boxes of individuals not related to the Royal Household

CLAIM sentence:  The phone records of Mr Mulcaire taken together with his papers (in which he had recorded the mobile phone numbers of other journalists) demonstrated that Mr Mulcaire had made calls to journalists other than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  The lack of cooperation on the part of NI with the investigation (both by interfering with the search of the Wapping offices and in their response, through Burton Copeland, to requests for documents and information which might implicate others at NI) bolstered the belief that the criminality permeated wider within NI than just Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams was correct to assert that in order to prosecute any of the individuals referred to by the corner names he would have needed to be in a position to prove cogently who they were and that they had requested or received the information in the knowledge that Mr Mulcaire obtained information through voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  He explained that what was absent from the seized material was any specific instructions to Mr Mulcaire to undertake any criminal activity that could be connected to a particular person, or what it was he did and who he sent it to and how he billed it 

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, it was put to him that it was likely, or at least a plausible picture, that Mr Mulcaire said to the journalist on the phone: Ive listened to celebrity Xs voicemail and this is what I can tell you is on the voicemail

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams agreed that it was a plausible picture but stated that he had no evidence of that to put before a court

CLAIM sentence:  Had he not been aware of the potential value of the evidential leads, he would not have considered it necessary to ask Mr Clarke to decide whether further resources should be committed to the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams may not have labelled or analysed the material in his own mind as circumstantial or inferential evidence but it would be wrong to find, in  at least, that he did not appreciate that there was some evidence; as the section below demonstrates, however, that made no difference to the decision made by Mr Clarke

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, in his evidence DI Maberly explained that he believed that three of the corner names in particular were the names of journalists at the NoTW but went on to say: We had some inference; we had no evidence

CLAIM sentence:  I conclude this section by emphasising that it would not be fair to seek to infer from the fact that a number of prosecutions are now being undertaken that the conclusions then reached by the officers were wrong, let alone that they were not objectively and fairly reached

CLAIM sentence:  The decision If the investigation was to continue, DCS Williams was of the view that the next step would be a detailed analysis of the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees was also of the view that pursuing the evidential leads would have required a step-change in the investigation, which would include a thorough analysis of the material seized from Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, he considered that the guilty knowledge of those identified by the corner names would be difficult to prove and would require a full scale criminal investigation sanctioned by senior officers in SO

CLAIM sentence:  He said: in terms of widening the suspect pool, that is a protracted piece of work, because wed have to go through the whole process again of trying to identify, et cetera

CLAIM sentence:  Against that background, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees briefed Mr Clarke, Commander McDowell and DCS White as to the current state of the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams said that senior management were aware that the investigators believed that NI had not been cooperating with the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke explained that in order properly to analyse the material and to be in a position to present it as evidence in a prosecution, it would have been necessary to index the material (manually, because at that time there was no way of scanning documents onto the HOLMES system); cross-reference it; research every phone number and subject it to an individual RIPA application to obtain data; and then analyse that data

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke said that it would have been an an enormous undertaking

CLAIM sentence:  On the question of the possibility of requesting support from elsewhere in the police service, Mr Clarke quoted in his witness statement from his evidence before the Home Affairs Select Committee in July : I took the view that it would be completely unrealistic, given that we were heading towards a prosecution of Goodman and Mulcaire, to then go to another department and say, Weve got a prosecution running

CLAIM sentence:  We dont know, given the uncertainties of the legal advice, whether there will be further offences coming from this or not

CLAIM sentence:  Would you like to devote , ,  officers for a protracted period to do this? I took the judgment that that would be an unreasonable request and so I didnt make it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke gave more detail about his rationale in his witness statement: First, given the wider context of counter terrorist operations that posed an immediate threat to the British public, when set against a criminal course of conduct that involved gross breaches of privacy but no apparent threat of physical harm to the public, I could not justify the huge expenditure of resources this would entail over an inevitably protracted period

CLAIM sentence:  A legitimate concern has been expressed that Mr Clarkes decision was underpinned by a briefing from DCS Williams, and therefore that he might have been told by DCS Williams that the investigation had uncovered no evidence implicating other journalists, or, if DCS Williams at least mentioned the evidential leads (which, as it happens, I do not doubt that he did), he would have expressed a cautious view of their potential value or viability

CLAIM sentence:  The first point to note is that throughout the investigation Mr Clarke (and indeed DCS White and Commander McDowell) received regular briefings, from both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees, at which the evidence and potential direction of the investigation were discussed (and at which decisions were made to limit the investigation)

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore not the case that before  pp-, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The precise content of the briefing received by Mr Clarke cannot now be ascertained, but the evidence given by Mr Clarke demonstrates that even with the fullest understanding of the quality of the evidence, his decision would have been the same

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke agreed that it probably followed that even if one could fairly characterise the evidence, particularly in relation to the three journalists, as strong circumstantial or inferential, that his decision not to pursue them would have been exactly the same: Strong circumstantial evidence in terms of trying to prove a conspiracy within a major newspaper group, it might it wont get you, I would suggest, it would be very unlikely to get you to the position of a successful prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke answered as follows: Its told me that theres more information there What I can say is that I havent seen anything which would cause me to make a different decision than the one I did then in terms of the allocation and resources, and I say that because we referred earlier to the overall strategy, which was to try to bring this criminality to an end by the prosecution of a senior, high-profile journalist, through working with the industry and through passing information to government

CLAIM sentence:  I asked Mr Clarke whether, in fact, the decision was not even close, not because of the quality of the evidence but because he was coping with  terrorist operations on a monumental scale

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke said that this was very close to being spot on: because the minutiae of whether there was circumstantial evidence against journalist A, B or C is a minor consideration in comparison with the consideration of what poses a threat to the lives of the British public

CLAIM sentence:  Invasions of privacy are odious, obviously

CLAIM sentence:  They can be extraordinarily distressing and at time they can be illegal, but, to put it bluntly, they dont kill you

CLAIM sentence:  Terrorists do

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke continued by explaining that it would have taken a huge amount of very strong, compelling evidence to persuade me that we should take a different course

CLAIM sentence:  Even that, however, would not have guaranteed that the matter would have been investigated further, only that he would have had better grounds to approach another part of the police service  Further, DCS Surtees has specifically emphasised that he discussed his view of the outstanding leads in detail with DCS White and other supervisors in August/September   pp-, lines -, Peter Clarke, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke said: If officers had come to me and said: Look, we have very clear technical evidence here that these journalists are involved in phone hacking, that would have given me something more then to try to move the operation somewhere else, something to explain to colleagues why they should devote their own precious resources to what would inevitably be an enormous operation, but that simply wasnt there

CLAIM sentence:  It is also worth noting that both the SIO and his deputy clearly agreed with Mr Clarkes decision

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams put it this way: ultimately the decision was Mr Clarkes and I have worked with him since 

CLAIM sentence:  He is the most professional man that Ive ever worked for, and I have absolute confidence in his integrity

CLAIM sentence:  We were all acutely aware of the very difficult decisions that ultimately he would have to make and the rationale for it, and I do agree with it

CLAIM sentence:   He went on to make it clear that, despite Mr Clarkes evident reputation for integrity, he would not have accepted without challenge what he perceived to be a perverse decision

CLAIM sentence:  He said: Had I been concerned about the legitimacy or otherwise of that decision, I would have taken that elsewhere

CLAIM sentence:  If Peter Clarke had made a decision based on resource, and my experience was that there was lots of resource, and I thought the decision was perverse, then I would have taken that elsewhere

CLAIM sentence:  That was absolutely not my position when the decision was communicated down to me

CLAIM sentence:  I was fully aware of where we were within the anti- terrorism branch or counter terrorism command at that time

CLAIM sentence:  Neither Mr Hayman nor Lord Blair had any apparent input into this decision

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman could not recall a conversation with Mr Clarke about the possible widening of the investigation to embrace other journalists and had not appreciated the significance of what the investigation had turned up at the time (in relation to the number of potential victims and the corner names of journalists)

CLAIM sentence:  Even if he had, he would have accepted the decision made by Mr Clarke not to widen the investigation because he was one of the people weighing up the competing demands on resources

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Blair said that it never occurred to him to ask whether there was further evidence of similar offences or offenders and nor was he told that that was the case

CLAIM sentence:  He said that these were fragmentary conversations about something which was considered of relatively minor importance in comparison to the unfolding threats of mass casualty terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Blair expressed the view in his evidence that although the decision Mr Clarke made was a reasonable one, it would have been open to Mr Clarke to escalate the matter to Mr Hayman, the Deputy Commissioner or up to him, any of whom might have decided to hand the investigation to another part of the organisation, possibly the specialist crime directorate, for a scoping study in due course

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Blair said that: It could have been taken out and parked

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst an alternative course may have been available to Mr Clarke, it would not be right to criticise Mr Clarke in any way for taking that course in the circumstances he has described

CLAIM sentence:  He was an impressive witness

CLAIM sentence:  His evidence regarding the terrorist threat to life and his prioritisation decision was given with force and in a convincing manner

CLAIM sentence:  I conclude unhesitatingly not only that Mr Clarke was entitled to reach the decision that he did but that, to such extent as it is appropriate for me to express an opinion, he was right to decide that no further anti-terrorist resources would be committed to investigating the breaches of privacy occasioned by voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  Even if the potency of the potential evidential leads were not explained during the briefing, that fact made no difference to the outcome

CLAIM sentence:  There was no question that Mr Clarke had to satisfy the demand for resources that the terrorist threat presented and that he was forced to make resourcing decisions that might not have been justifiable if the quantum of the threat were not so large

CLAIM sentence:  I have no doubt, in any event, that Mr Clarke would not have countenanced such a factor having any bearing on his decision-making

CLAIM sentence:  Recording the decision 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke said that his belief was that, in the final analysis, Commander McDowall and DCS White would have briefed him and he would have said to them: Okay, go and see the SIOs,  p, lines -, Lord Blair, http://www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Lord- Blair

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke believes that he made this ultimate decision around the end of September ; DCS Williams believed that it was around September, possibly October

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke went on to say that although briefing meetings were not themselves documented or the subject of minutes, he would expect the product of those meetings to be recorded in the SIOs decision log

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams has contended that it would have been for Mr Clarke, as the decision-maker, to record the decision

CLAIM sentence:  In this case, for whatever reason, it did not happen: there is thus no contemporaneous written record of Mr Clarkes decision or its rationale

CLAIM sentence:  It follows that I entirely endorse Mr Clarkes comment that where the police decide not to deal with a particular piece of criminality by what might be described as the conventional course of arrest and prosecution, there may be circumstances where the rationale needs to be made clear to others, so that the sorts of insinuations that have been made about my officers who conducted that inquiry in  can more easily be shown to be baseless

CLAIM sentence:  The four detectives roundly rejected this is as a realistic option on the basis that, in all likelihood, the journalists would have made no comment in interview, as did Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire; the police would have been no further forward

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to this suggestion, Mr Clarke remarked: Would it be reasonable, bearing in mind that we were being completely thwarted and receiving no co-operation from News International whatsoever, to go out and arrest two or three journalists, invite them to make a full and frank confession of what theyd been doing, because we wouldnt, without analysis of all that material, have substantial issues to put to them? It would be a complete reverse of good investigative practice to do that

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams said: My opinion is that to do a proper and professional investigation to interview anyone, it has to be done from a position of knowledge, and that in many investigations simply going and asking someone to give an explanation quite often results in no comment, in exactly the same way in my early decision logs I could have gone and seen Mr Goodman and it is highly unlikely that we would have got very far in the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams continued: This is my personal belief as an investigator, and maybe others will judge my threshold is too high, but given my experience of investigations and presenting a case before a court, I obviously have a personal higher threshold than others as to what I believe in terms of the right thing to do in terms of reasonable ground before I start depriving other people of their liberty

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly made the following observations on this subject: There would have been aspects of the case that I would have liked to have asked them about, but I had no firm evidence of either their knowledge of voicemail interception or of them tasking Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  This is something that I would have looked to find before speaking to them, because it would have been the case that, you know, if we did bring them in for questioning, the likelihood is that they would have made no comment, as did the other two employees of News of the World

CLAIM sentence:  We would have got nowhere

CLAIM sentence:  I have no difficulty in accepting that this collective view that there would have been nothing to gain from arresting the three journalists, without further investigation, was (as Mr Clarke pointed out) in keeping with good investigative practice; it was both reasonable and entirely honestly held

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams explained that he would need more than a corner name that happened to be the first name of someone employed by the paper: To put together a criminal investigation, I wouldnt just use that one facet

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees explained that the phone records for a given individual reveal thousands of lines of incoming telephone calls

CLAIM sentence:  However, he also pointed out that the phone records would not show which of the incoming calls were seeking remote access to voicemail and which were ordinary phone calls to the victim

CLAIM sentence:  It follows that it was quite likely that even after the individual had eliminated all the numbers he or she could recognise, the police would be left with many numbers which may or may not have called the voicemail box

CLAIM sentence:  The tenor of the evidence of Mr Clarke was that he agreed with DCS Williams and DCS Surtees

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke was asked whether it would have been possible to carry out a more abbreviated analysis, looking at a sample of victims and the three journalists in the sight lines of DI Maberly

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke agreed, when challenged, that there could have been a more limited and streamlined analysis of the material which focussed on the three journalists

CLAIM sentence:  It is suggested that this would be virtually the same evidence as was used to convict Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  It is right, as DCS Williams explained in evidence, that the evidence in support of counts  to  comprised a high volume of frequency of calls made by Mr Mulcaire to the relevant voicemail box and the  p, lines -, Philip Williams, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  However, the approach suggested is too simplistic not least because the evidence implicating Mr Goodman in the conspiracy went significantly beyond his name appearing in the top corner of Mr Mulcaires notes

CLAIM sentence:  Influence of News International It has also been argued that there is a strong implication that the conduct of DCS Williams (in telling counsel, the CPS and subsequently Mr Yates that there was no evidence that any other journalists were involved and in later not pursuing the agreed strategy of informing victims) derived from his fear of the powerful media friends of his superiors and reflects a wider institutional fear of NI and his awareness of the close social relationships fostered by the company with his superiors

CLAIM sentence:  It has been contended that although there is no evidence that DCS Williams made any conscious decision to suppress evidence, it is inevitable that the relationships exerted some influence on his decision-making

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to this aspect of the case, I reject these arguments

CLAIM sentence:  The ultimate decision (as it has been called) was made by Mr Clarke

CLAIM sentence:  As to the attitude to the investigation, DCS Williams said that: no one in my team had any contact with any of the newspapers, and I can assure you at no time in that investigation was it ever an issue, did we ever discuss it, did it ever influence the direction that we went in with that investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Second, DCS Williams did not suppress evidence; and I have accepted that DCS Williams was not intending to convey to counsel or the CPS that there was no evidence whatsoever to implicate other journalists, only that there was insufficient evidence to lay before a criminal Court

CLAIM sentence:  Suffice to say, having seen the senior members of the investigating team, I have no doubt that they approached their task with complete integrity

CLAIM sentence:  I am satisfied that had Mr Clarke, at the end of September , sanctioned the exhaustive analysis of the documentation seized from Mr Mulcaire, the investigators would have embarked on that task with the zeal and rigour they had demonstrated since Operation Caryatid had begun

CLAIM sentence:  Given how little was known about voicemail interception when the investigation began in December  and the challenges involved in understanding how the interceptions were taking place and then proving the interceptions, it could only have been (and was) a robust, tenacious, well-motivated and skilful team that could have secured such extensive evidence that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire were driven to admit their guilt

CLAIM sentence:  I do not find they were deterred in their investigation by fear of getting on the wrong side of such a powerful organisation or displeasing senior management by risking damage to the MPSs working relationship with NI

CLAIM sentence:  This is explored in section  below  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xc

CLAIM sentence:  As an indication of DCS Surtees enthusiasm in particular, I note that he said in evidence that, when producing his search strategy: I wanted very much to get into News International, because I wanted to search the desk, I wanted to search the financial areas, I wanted to find evidence around who was involved in this illegal activity

CLAIM sentence:  On this topic, Mr Clarke observed that: [the investigating officers] conducted an honest inquiry, they were uninfluenced, as was I, by anything to do with News International or any media group

CLAIM sentence:  In the context of his evidence about the perception caused by his relationships with individuals from NI, Mr Hayman stressed: I can absolutely accord with your point around perception, but I can tell you that the team on it are ferocious, they have a reputation of being ferocious, and if, lets say, there is a scenario, which some people have argued around the conspiracy that there was a not such ferociousness around because of a perceived relationship, it was impossible, in my view

CLAIM sentence:  If you wanted to be disproportionate towards those alleged perpetrators, or you wanted to dilute down the investigation, the security and parameters that were set by the SIO would make that impossible

CLAIM sentence:  The victim notification strategy In order to examine how the police intended to address issues concerning the victims of voicemail interception, it is necessary to return to  August  (three days after the conference with counsel) on which date DCS Williams met with Mr Clarke and DCS White

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarkes recollection is that the purpose of the meeting was to devise and produce a victim notification strategy

CLAIM sentence:  He said that: Bearing in mind that there had been very close co-operation between my officers and the mobile phone industry throughout the investigation, it was agreed that after the arrests there would be a strategy for informing victims whereby police officers would inform certain categories of potential victim, and the mobile phone companies would identify and inform others

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke was asked whether it was his intention that the  names on the original list of potential victims, which was prepared shortly after  August , would be notified one way or the other, either directly by the police or by the mobile phone companies

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke said: Yes, absolutely

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke said that he did not have any oversight over the execution of the strategy because he would not be expected to do so and by then he was fully immersed in Operation Overt

CLAIM sentence:  Given that Mr Clarke had no further involvement in the victim notification strategy after that meeting, it does not appear that he saw the document or was asked to agree the detail of the strategy

CLAIM sentence:  The following are material extracts from the document: Situation Material seized during the executive action phase of Op Caryatid has been assessed and at this stage there are approximately  potential victims whose details are recorded by Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence: pdf; (document not published)  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcThere is a need to establish definitely how many victims there are, i

CLAIM sentence:  With that in mind all  of the UK mobile phone companies have been asked to search their UVN equivalents for any of our suspect phone numbers calling them going as far back as possible up to one year, dependant [sic] upon data retention

CLAIM sentence:  Time frame up to  weeks, but variable due to Op Overt

CLAIM sentence:  Using the information that will come from the mobile phone service providers together with an assessment of material seized, police/Council [sic] can choose an appropriate range of victims subject to their agreement to add to the charges

CLAIM sentence:  From all that is known, the risk to the victims does not extend to a risk to life or serious injury/damage to property, but rather the goal of the criminality is to seek material of media interest typically salacious gossip! Arguably any immediate and future risk has been negated by virtue of the fact that police now hold the suspects data on their victims and the fact that they have been detected acts as a deterrent for them or anyone else to target these victims

CLAIM sentence:  The latter four categories would include those that are on Mulcaires list whether or not any investigation shows that their UVN has been dialled

CLAIM sentence:  Inform all victims i

CLAIM sentence:  As per  above, but vary the when and how

CLAIM sentence:  The four categories identified in option  should be informed now and the remainder can be informed once the definitive list is complete following responses from the phone companies

CLAIM sentence:  Police would lead on informing the former group whereas the latter group could be informed by the respective victim phone company via an agreed police/mobile phone companies letter

CLAIM sentence:  Recommended Option Option  is my preferred option because: It deals with the risks to individuals in a proportionate manner

CLAIM sentence:  The phone companies are the most effective and efficient means of contacting the victims in the majority of cases

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams explained in his witness statement that: I felt that there was arguably a duty to inform people who may have been a victim of crime in this case and I felt that this was best defined by for those people who we know are victims by virtue of the fact that our suspects called their voicemails

CLAIM sentence:  If those people could be identified it was a case of by whom, how and when those people would be informed

CLAIM sentence:  The rationale for such a distinction was based upon a proportionate sharing of the resources that would be required, the level of risk/harm and who, police or service providers, had the best discrete [sic] channels to carry out the task

CLAIM sentence:  He provided additional insight into his thinking at the time during the course of his briefing to the Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, in : At the time the strategy recognised that there was still extensive research to be done with the phone companies to identify what the full extent of victims might be and therefore as outlined under the section above How were victims identified this could be a vastly bigger group of people and in reality we would probably never know the true scale

CLAIM sentence:  This strategy was therefore seeking to alert potential past victims in a proportionate manner without causing undue alarm (i

CLAIM sentence:  contact via Phone Company as opposed to police) and set in motion measures within the overall mobile phone industry to prevent it happening in the future

CLAIM sentence:  In summary therefore, the plan was for the police to notify immediately those identified in the blue book (the  individuals) who fell into the category of MP, Royal Household, Police and Military, regardless of whether there was evidence that their voicemail boxes had been dialled by the suspect numbers

CLAIM sentence:  Individuals outside those four categories would be notified provided their voicemail box had been rung by Mr Goodman or Mr Mulcaire or both but  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams explained that this latter group of victims would comprise those in the blue book whose voicemails had been rung by the suspect numbers (but who were not MPs, members of the Royal Household, police of military) and any additional individuals that the phone companies brought to their attention

CLAIM sentence:  This latter group of individuals would be informed by their phone company, by way of a letter agreed between the police and the phone company, but not until the phone companies had responded to the request that they identify as many of their customers as they could whose voicemail boxes had been rung by the suspect numbers (so that a definitive list could be compiled)

CLAIM sentence:  I find that it was reasonable for the police to put in place a three-track strategy for the prosecution: namely (i) conducting a high-profile but limited prosecution (limited in terms of victims named on the indictment); (ii) alerting the phone companies so that they could improve security and change their procedures as appropriate and (iii) warning people who were the subject of criminal attention

CLAIM sentence:  However, the victim notification strategy was both poorly thought out and scarcely executed

CLAIM sentence:  The strategy therefore overlooked people who were identified in the blue book, and in respect of whom Mr Mulcaire had the wherewithal to access the voicemail accounts, but whose voicemails may have been accessed by an as yet unidentified suspect number, such as a number belonging to someone other than Mr Goodman or Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  The strategy also overlooked the fact that the phone companies only held their records for a short period of time and it thereby excluded those whose voicemails had been accessed by the identified suspect numbers but at such an early date that the relevant records had not been retained

CLAIM sentence: uk/evidence/?witness=dcs-keith-surtees  The list of names comprised people of interest to Mr Mulcaire, in respect of whom Mr Mulcaire either had the wherewithal to access their voicemails or was in the process of obtaining that wherewithal; p, lines -, http:// www

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing--February-

CLAIM sentence: pdf  The strategy did not therefore fulfil Mr Clarkes intention that all  individuals listed in the blue book would be informed, which is a further indication that Mr Clarke did not agree the detail of the strategy  pp-, lines -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Without suggesting to DCS Surtees that it was his responsibility to do so, it was put to him that it would not have been an enormous task to contact everyone in the blue book and make sure that everyone was told that there was some information that their voicemail messages may have been intercepted, that it may not be possible to prosecute for reasons that could be explained, but that they ought to be aware of that fact and take appropriate security arrangements or, at least, be alert

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees responded as follows: I accept that

CLAIM sentence:  In terms of the Blue Book and in terms of the document that was produced later, which was a document produced as a result of the analysis of the electronic media, which I think came to us on  November , in relation to both those documents, I accept that, the Metropolitan Police, could have approached all of those people and said, Look what is on a piece of paper, or, Look what is on a document and look how it relates to you

CLAIM sentence:  In my view, the police ought either to have informed those named in the blue book themselves, or have agreed with the phone companies that the latter would do so, and given them the means to do so by providing the list of names

CLAIM sentence:  The police ought then to have checked with the phone companies to ensure that all relevant individuals had been informed

CLAIM sentence:  Insofar as the police had concerns about their obligations under the Data Protection Act  when giving any names to the phone companies, this was a matter that could doubtless have been discussed and resolved: ultimately, the police could have avoided those concerns by informing those individuals themselves

CLAIM sentence:  Unfortunately, not only was the strategy ill-conceived but, in addition, its execution was woefully inadequate

CLAIM sentence:  The police appear to have assumed that having been asked to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes had been called by the suspect numbers, the phone companies would naturally inform all those that they identified

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams explained his thinking as follows: When I wrote the strategy, it was based on what I believed was already happening in terms of our relationship with the service providers and as the case progressed to prosecution that ongoing support, discovery, cooperation and joint media releases  In his witness statement, at para , DCS Surtees had said that informing victims beyond those categorised as military, police, MPs and Royal Household, would have involved a huge and labour intensive commitment from SO  p, lines -, Keith Surtees, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams even appears to have contemplated that the phone companies would identify potential victims and notify them without giving the police their names

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees described it as his understanding that the telephone companies would tell those other than MPs, members of the military, members of the Royal Household and police that their phones had potentially been accessed

CLAIM sentence:  My view was that the telephone companies were responsible for their customers, as is the case in other areas of business such as in the banking industry

CLAIM sentence:  Like with O, the emphasis was still very much on the phone companies to deal with their customers in a professional manner

CLAIM sentence:  The telephone companies knew which of their customers were subject to illegal access because it was they who told us in the first place

CLAIM sentence:  It does appear, therefore, that no attempt was even made to agree the strategy with the phone companies

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, there is no evidence of joint letters being agreed with the phone companies, despite this being the intention identified by the strategy

CLAIM sentence:  I therefore do not accept the argument of the MPS that the failure of the strategy was due to a misunderstanding between the MPS and the phone companies as to which categories of victims should be informed and by whom

CLAIM sentence:  The strategy failed because the MPS did not take the necessary steps to put it into effect

CLAIM sentence:  As late as , when briefing Mr Yates, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees did not even appear to have been aware that the strategy had failed

CLAIM sentence:  In a briefing note dated  July , they stated: It is not known in detail what each mobile phone company actually did, but anecdotally we know that upon learning of the flaws in their processes the phone companies took steps prevent future breaches and albeit these measures varied from company to company they included contacting customers who they thought might have been a victim 

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees has also added that the decision made by Mr Clarke not to expend any further resources on the operation affected the victim notification strategy

CLAIM sentence:  He said that after the decision had been made not to expand the investigation, he received the direction that staff should only service the prosecution, and consequently, there were no staff to follow up with the phone companies what they were doing regarding victim notification

CLAIM sentence:  It does not, however, seem that anyone went back to Mr Clarke and reminded him of the resources needed to implement the strategy which, in outline, he had approved

CLAIM sentence:  The decision made by Mr Clarke and the demand on resources may provide some explanation (but no excuse) for why these important steps in the process were apparently overlooked but the significance of the failure should not be minimised: it was a failure to take even basic steps to follow up the strategy and to ensure that it had worked as intended

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke expressed his regret for the failure of the strategy in his witness statement: I have since learned that this strategy did not work as intended and as former Assistant Commissioner John Yates has publicly acknowledged, that is a matter of profound regret

CLAIM sentence:  During his evidence Mr Clarke emphasised that his hope had been that the victim notification strategy would be comprehensive and would work

CLAIM sentence:  He said: Sadly, it turned out not to be the case and to this day I dont really understand why it didnt work

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams said: This strategy did not seek to hide the potential to be a victim of this behaviour

CLAIM sentence:  It has been asserted that the failure to alert Lord Prescott, in particular, to the fact that he was a potential victim strongly supports the allegation that the police deliberately avoided notifying certain victims since, if Lord Prescott had been alerted, he is likely to have reacted to this revelation in such a way which would have made it very difficult for the police not to expand the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams was asked about the material relating to Lord Prescott

CLAIM sentence:  He said: I dont know whether I knew that specific bit in the sense of it sat here in this interview

CLAIM sentence:  It is extremely unfortunate that, apparently, DCS Williams was not made fully aware of the fact that the investigators suspected that Lord Prescott had been or, at the very least, was at risk of being, a victim, not least because of the significance of his position as Deputy Prime Minister

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, I consider it highly unlikely that this omission or the consequential failure to inform Lord Prescott was deliberate

CLAIM sentence:  As DCS Surtees explained in evidence: There was a communication strategy which was devised in  and it was multifaceted

CLAIM sentence:  So there were through the process of August into January  a number of media lines put out and a lot of media coverage as a result of that

CLAIM sentence:  Further, the police informed the PCC and Mr Clarke is absolutely clear in his mind that he made the government aware of the investigation when Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire had been arrested

CLAIM sentence:  He said in his witness statement: I recall discussing the case with Dr John Reid, the then Home Secretary, shortly after Goodman and Mulcaire had been arrested

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Reid confirmed this to the extent that he agreed it was quite possible that the subject of their arrests was mentioned informally by Mr Clarke though he personally does not recall a specific conversation

CLAIM sentence:  He added: I do recall the issue being touched upon much later in one conversation with the Met Commissioner towards the end of my period in office My recollection is of being told that work continued following the recent trial that had concluded in late January ; that there was a considerable amount of material arising out of the trial and the investigations related to it; but that material did not equal evidence, and it would take some time to work through it with a view to gathering evidence

CLAIM sentence:  This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the fact that, towards the end of September , Mr Clarke decided that no further analysis of the material would take place

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Reid continued as follows: So that was certainly my impression when I left office, that having carried out the convictions on Goodman and Mulcaire, that now what was being done on the generality of it because there were other suspected victims of this

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Reid said that he was never made aware that were perhaps hundreds of victims and thousands of names or that Lord Prescott was one of names in which Mr Mulcaire could be seen to be interested, whether or not his phone messages or the phone messages of one his staff were actually the subject of interception

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, Mrs Brooks was informed that she was a victim and, on  October , DCS Surtees emailed the Mail on Sunday a list of five members of staff who had been found to be the victim of voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  It is said that this position is to be contrasted with that of Brian Paddick, Lord Prescott and Simon Hughes

CLAIM sentence:  Brian Paddick was a Commander serving with the MPS at the material time; his name appeared in the project list created by the High Tech Crime Unit from information held on Mr Mulcaires computer

CLAIM sentence:  There were also references in Mr Mulcaires papers which included the name of Mr Paddick, his address,  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  It was only in  that Mr Paddick was informed

CLAIM sentence:  Further, although Rt Hon Simon Hughes MP was an identified victim and the subject of one of the charges in the criminal trial, he was not told that Mr Mulcaire had recorded in his notebook not only details about him but also his friends and family along with the names of three NoTW journalists other than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  This might have been as a result of direct notification or by involving mobile phone companies but it had to be done and steps taken to ensure that it had been done

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, the police did notify a number of those who were not related to the media (including, for instance, George Galloway who was told on  August )

CLAIM sentence:  The failure to warn NI or challenge the one rogue reporter assertion 

CLAIM sentence:  The police were aware that there were very strong grounds for believing that journalists at NI, other than Mr Goodman, had been involved in unlawful voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  They had identified that the practice might be widespread

CLAIM sentence:  Given the extent of the material in the Mulcaire archive and the collation of that material in the blue book, one possible additional step would have been to alert senior management at NoTW and NI of their concern about the extent of the criminality so that the management could review their systems of corporate governance, possibly to institute their own internal investigation into the relationship between the NoTW and Mr Mulcaire which had permitted him to earn so much money and, in the event that payments could not be justified to take such steps as they thought appropriate to deal with the position

CLAIM sentence:  It could have been explained to NI that there were other leads in the material which they had seized which could have revealed more widespread criminality but that were not being pursued because of significant competing priorities to deal with counter terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  This is not to suggest that the police should have undertaken any duty to monitor NI for which they had neither power nor resources

CLAIM sentence:  Taking this step might have led NI and NoTW to be rather less forceful in their assertion of the line that Mr Goodman represented one rogue reporter

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, when the police became aware that NIs public approach was that Mr Goodman had been working alone, at the very least, the police should have been prepared to point to the observations of Mr Perry, the conclusion of Mr Justice Gross and the fact that their investigation (necessarily not taken as far as it could have been taken because of counter terrorism) should not be taken as  pp-, paras -, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  It was to show people: if you are doing this, whoever you are and wherever you are, actually it is clearly criminally wrong, and youll go to prison, and if youre an organisation that knows that you seek information and you should be thinking to yourselves, I wonder if weve got any vulnerabilities? thats what we do as a learning organisation in the police

CLAIM sentence:  Bearing in mind the one rogue reporter defence, the reverse was more likely to be the case

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment, however, these submissions overstate the case: an aborted search that was not renewed and letters requesting documentation, both of which entailed no repercussions for NI sent no warning signal at all

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS makes the further submission that it is evident from the recent arrests and various charges in Operation Weeting that there is at least material for suggesting that others at NI either knew or feared very much more extensive criminality

CLAIM sentence:  Without prejudicing the ongoing criminal investigation and prosecution, it is not right to go further although it is sufficient to point to Mr Mylers comment about bombs under the newsroom floor as identifying his concern which was hardly consistent with the stated line

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, the MPS argues that any approach by the MPS to NI in an unofficial capacity to seek compliance could have been perceived by others as inappropriately cosy and DCS Williams has said that he was operating under the general instruction from Mr Clarke not to engage with the media

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS would not, however, be acting in an unofficial capacity and it is not correct to suggest that a formal approach by senior officers, at a fully documented and minuted meeting, delivering the warning and advice outlined above, could be perceived as overly cosy or otherwise inappropriate, or of a nature that Mr Clarke would prohibit

CLAIM sentence: \t The\treaction\tof\tthe\tNews\tof\tthe\tWorld Change of editors The one significant change that occurred at the NoTW following the prosecution was the resignation of Andy Coulson and appointment of Colin Myler as editor

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Coulson said in 

CLAIM sentence:  evidence that his resignation was his decision, reached without any prior discussion with Mr Murdoch or Mr Hinton: I went to see Les Hinton and I was very clear that I was going to resign, and then I did so

CLAIM sentence:  Accepting this evidence, which has not been contested in any way, the replacement of Mr Coulson as editor was not a step taken by NI to effect a culture change, so much as a convenient opportunity

CLAIM sentence:  On his departure, Mr Coulson received compensation in lieu of notice and compensation for termination of employment

CLAIM sentence:  This appears to suggest a gesture of good will on the part of NI to Mr Coulson at the point of his personal decision to accept editorial responsibility for what had happened

CLAIM sentence:  According to the oral evidence of Rupert Murdoch, Mr Myler was appointed to find out what the hell was going on

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Murdoch testified after Mr Myler and his version of events could not be put to the latter when he gave evidence in Module 

CLAIM sentence:  Having been given the opportunity to comment on Mr Murdochs account, Mr Myler contends that he was given no such brief either in these somewhat colourful terms or otherwise, and that he simply understood his role as being to edit the paper

CLAIM sentence:  In response, Rupert Murdoch has clarified that it certainly was his understanding from Les Hinton that Mr Myler was appointed to find out what the hell was going on, and that it would not been possible for the latter to have moved the paper forward by improving its practices and governance, to avoid a repetition of the conduct which had led to the criminal convictions, without ascertaining what had gone wrong in the past

CLAIM sentence:  The upshot was that Mr Myler appears to have decided that his function should be forward-looking: the trauma of what had happened with the Goodman/Mulcaire trial left a very deep, as I say, trauma within the newspaper and the morale of the staff

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler claimed, however, to be uneasy with the situation: Its fair to say that I always had some discomfort and I always the term I phrased was I felt that there could have been bombs under the newsroom floor and I didnt know where they were and I didnt know when they were going to go off

CLAIM sentence:  The one rogue reporter claim The PCC 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Tim Toulmin, then Director of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said that the PCC had neither the legal powers nor the authority vested in it by the newspaper industry to institute an inquiry into other possible instances of unlawful voicemail interception at the NoTW or more generally in the press, but that it wanted to do something useful to complement the police inquiry so that light could be shone on what had gone wrong, and so that lessons could be learned to ensure that there was no repetition

CLAIM sentence:  Accordingly, on  February , Mr Toulmin wrote to Mr Myler asking a number of questions about the conduct of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and asking him what the newspaper proposed to do to ensure that the conduct was not repeated

CLAIM sentence:  In his reply, Mr Myler urged the PCC to see the episode in perspective on the basis that it represented: an exceptional and unhappy event in the  year history of the News of the World, involving one journalist

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler also emphasised the newspapers commitment to the Code of Practice, drawing attention, by way of example, to an episode where it had dismissed a reporter for breaching the provisions of the Code

CLAIM sentence:  He said that:  Every single News of the World journalist is conversant with the Code and appreciates fully the necessity of total compliance

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler described Mr Goodman as a rogue exception

CLAIM sentence:  This is possibly the first use of what later became established as the one rogue reporter defence

CLAIM sentence:   PCC phone message hacking report March , paras 

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC concluded that:  No evidence has emerged either from the legal proceedings or the Commissions questions to Mr Myler and Mr Hinton of a conspiracy at the newspaper going beyond Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire to subvert the law and the PCCs Code of Practice

CLAIM sentence:  There is no evidence to challenge Mr Mylers assertion that: Goodman had deceived his employer in order to obtain cash to pay Mulcaire; that he had concealed the identity of the source of information on royal stories; and that no-one else at the News of the World knew that Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone messages for stories

CLAIM sentence:  However, internal controls at the newspaper were clearly inadequate for the purpose of identifying the deception

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , Les Hinton, Chairman of NI, appeared in front of the Culture Media and Sports Committee of the House of Commons (CMS Committee), which at that time was conducting an inquiry into self-regulation of the press

CLAIM sentence:  Voicemail interception was only briefly touched on at the hearing

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hinton told the Committee that a, full, rigorous internal inquiry was being carried out and that he (Hinton) was absolutely convinced that Mr Goodman was the only person who knew what was going on

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee noted this assurance without comment but were highly critical of the financial processes in place in NoTW that they had been told allowed Mr Goodman to employ Mr Mulcaire to intercept voicemail messages without appropriate oversight or authority from senior executives

CLAIM sentence:  Dismissal of Clive Goodman and his appeal It appears that Mr Goodman expected to continue his employment at the NoTW once he had served his sentence of imprisonment

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment, that perception is, in itself, quite extraordinary

CLAIM sentence:  There can be few employees who would expect to return to their jobs after serving a sentence of imprisonment for a serious criminal offence, particularly an offence committed in the course of their employment and, even more so, where (as was contended) what he was doing was wholly unknown and had been managed and financed by deceit

CLAIM sentence:  The NI Disciplinary Policy and Procedure provided for immediate dismissal without notice, or payment in lieu of notice, for various forms of gross misconduct including:  conviction for a criminal offence (including outside of work) which may bring News International into disrepute or otherwise impact on your suitability for employment with the Company

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances Mr Goodman should properly have expected to be dismissed without any form of financial compensation

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Goodman felt he had been given assurances by both Tom Crone (the lawyer employed by NI who had ultimate legal responsibility for editorial legal matters at the NoTW) and Andy Coulson that he could return to work at the NoTW once he had served his sentence providing he did not implicate in criminal conduct any of the newspapers other staff

CLAIM sentence:  In the event, this view was not shared by Mr Hinton because on  February  Mr Hinton wrote to Mr Goodman terminating his employment

CLAIM sentence:  The letter said:  I recognise this episode followed many unblemished, and frequently distinguished, years of service to the News of the World

CLAIM sentence:  In view of this, and in recognition of the pressures on your family, it has been decided that upon your termination you will receive one years salary

CLAIM sentence:  The terms of the dismissal were considerably more generous than the terms of his employment required, but Mr Goodman was not content

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , Mr Goodman wrote to Daniel Cloke, then head of Human Resources at NI, appealing against his dismissal

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , Mr Goodman submitted a lengthy list of documents which he wanted NI to provide for the purposes of his appeal

CLAIM sentence:  On  May  Jonathan Chapman, then Director of Legal Affairs for NI, instructed solicitors, Harbottle & Lewis, to carry out a review of the emails identified by Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Chapman sent formal instructions by email the following day to Lawrence Abramson, then managing partner at Harbottle & Lewis, which stated that: Because of the bad publicity that could result in an allegation in an employment tribunal that we had covered up potentially damaging evidence found on our email trawl, I would ask that you carry out an independent review of the emails in question and report back to me with any findings of material that could possibly tend to support either of Mr Goodmans contentions

CLAIM sentence:  It is revealing that the concern was to identify material that would cause the company further embarrassment or damage their prospects in an Employment Tribunal rather than ascertain whether the allegations made by Mr Goodman were true

CLAIM sentence:  On  May  Mr Abramson emailed Mr Chapman draft wording of his advice for consideration by him before it was formalised

CLAIM sentence:  The email read: We have on your instructions searched the emails that you were able to let us have access to from the accounts of [redacted names] I can confirm that we did not find any evidence that proved that [redacted names] knew that Clive Goodman, Glenn Mulcaire or any other journalists as the News of the World were engaged in illegal activities prior to their arrest

CLAIM sentence:  Later that day Mr Chapman suggested an addition to the advice, namely: Equally, having seen a copy of Clive Goodmans notice of appeal of  March , we did not find anything that we consider to be directly relevant to the grounds of appeal put forward by him

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Abramson declined to include this sentence because: I think the short answer is it wasnt the exercise wed been asked to conduct

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to note the limited exercise that Harbottle and Lewis had been asked to carry out and the correspondingly limited comfort that NI could legitimately derive from it when considering the broad question of whether there was evidence that the conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages extended beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Despite the assurance given by Mr Hinton to the CMS Committee that a full, rigorous internal inquiry was being carried out, there is no evidence that anyone at the NoTW made any proper effort to investigate the veracity of the allegations made by Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  Apart from the review of the emails by Harbottle and Lewis, the internal investigation of the allegations made by Mr Goodman was limited to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler, speaking to the individuals named by Mr Goodman to ask whether there was any substance to them

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler said in his evidence that:  in the absence of any evidence to support Mr Goodmans allegations they were denied

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Chapman said that the right thing to do was to investigate whether there was any foundation to the allegations

CLAIM sentence:  It does not appear that anyone at the title took seriously the possibility that the allegations were well-founded or, given the very substantial sums that he had been paid, even investigated precisely what Mr Mulcaire had been doing and for whom he had been working

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone said during his evidence that he had believed from the outset that the claim that the unlawful voicemail interception had been the action of one rogue reporter was wrong

CLAIM sentence:  He had formed a strong impression that what was said about others at News International commissioning Mulcaires accessing in relation to the non-royal victims was based upon more than circumstantial evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone agreed during his evidence that one reason for forming that view was that counts  to  did not relate to Royal issues and would therefore be outside Mr Goodmans area of interest

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone explained that he took no other action because the police showed no signs of continuing the investigation or making more arrests and the companys primary thought was to draw a line under it

CLAIM sentence:  Certainly it appears that whatever privileged discussions Mr Crone might have had he did nothing to change the view that Mr Myler had formed, namely that there was no evidence to justify an investigation into possible unlawful or unethical behaviour in the newsroom at the News of the World

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler explained that apart from the investigations into the allegations made by Mr Goodman during his appeal against his dismissal, he relied heavily on the fact that the police investigation had gone no further than the charges against Mr Goodman and had not resulted in any suggestion by the police to the News of the World that there was a wider problem

CLAIM sentence:  The Goodman and Mulcaire settlements In July  NI settled a claim for unfair dismissal brought by Mr Goodman, making a payment of a further , in addition to a , notice payment that had been made in February  when Mr Goodman was dismissed

CLAIM sentence:  The focus in dealing with Mr Goodmans claims was, according to Mr Chapman, to manage the risk of further reputational damage to the company

CLAIM sentence:  The circumstances of Mr Goodmans dismissal create an impression that his criminal conduct was viewed not as an outrageous breach of the law, the Code and the companys policies, but as something akin to a regrettable oversight in an old and trusted employee

CLAIM sentence:  The response to the conviction and Mr Goodmans allegations suggest that the possible widespread use of illegal methods of obtaining information was regarded, at the highest, as a reputational risk if exposed

CLAIM sentence:  There is no sign that the News of the World regarded the fact that criminal conduct may have flourished as a significant risk either from a corporate governance or operational perspective

CLAIM sentence:  The potential underlying truth of the allegations was apparently regarded as a second order issue

CLAIM sentence:  Running parallel with the dispute between NI and Mr Goodman was the similar dispute between NI and Mr Mulcaire, who was not an employee but who sought similar financial recompense

CLAIM sentence:  In April  Mr Mulcaire claimed that his contract with NI gave him employment rights and that NI had not followed the correct statutory procedures when it terminated the contract in January 

CLAIM sentence:  The view was taken that there was a significant risk that an employment tribunal would find that Mr Mulcaire did have employment rights

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Chapman explained his analysis: When I analysed the position, based on the usual parameters, mutuality of obligation, control, right of substitution, it looked very much to me like Mr Mulcaire was an employee, and I understand that subsequently Farrers took that view as well

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Mulcaire was paid approximately ,

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Chapman agreed that the reasoning process that led to alighting upon a settlement figure for Mr Mulcaire was more or less the same as that which applied to Mr Goodman, namely the need to limit reputational harm

CLAIM sentence:  The approach of the company to severance payments or payments in lieu to Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire does not appear to convey corporate concern at their criminality; the payment to Mr Coulson may be considered slightly differently but is starkly in contrast to its approach to other employees such as Mr Driscoll

CLAIM sentence:  The Gordon Taylor litigation 

CLAIM sentence:  The next significant event was the civil claim for damages brought by Gordon Taylor in the spring of 

CLAIM sentence:  As Mr Crone, Mr Chapman and Mr Myler stated repeatedly in evidence, the desire of the News of the World was to draw a line under the matter

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, the claim cannot have been well-received, not just because of the obvious financial implications, but also because of the potential reputational harm that would result even from only a repeat exposure of the facts of the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  The claim was brought against NGN and Mr Mulcaire for breach of confidence, misuse of private information and breach of privacy

CLAIM sentence:  When Mr Taylor served his claim he provided no documentary evidence to support it and NGN filed a defence denying any involvement

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Taylor then applied for, and obtained, an order requiring the police to release the prosecution papers and evidence to his solicitors

CLAIM sentence:  Among those papers was the contract between Mr Mulcaire and the News of the World to pay Mr Mulcaire , for information  pp-, lines -, Jonathan Chapman, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone recorded in a briefing note on  May  that this material was fatal to our case

CLAIM sentence:  Recognising the inevitable, Mr Crone instructed NGNs solicitors, Farrer & Co, to make an offer to Mr Taylor of , plus costs

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of the awards that had been made for breach of confidence and invasion of privacy, this was a very substantial offer but Mark Lewis, of the solicitors instructed to pursue the claim, replied that Mr Taylor was not interested in settling and wanted to take the matter to trial

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone sought advice from Michael Silverleaf QC about how NGN should proceed

CLAIM sentence:  The advice from Mr Silverleaf, dated  June , was very clear and echoed what Mr Crone had already concluded

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Silverleaf concluded that:  NGNs prospects of avoiding liability for the claims of breach of confidence and invasion of privacy are slim to the extent of being non-existent

CLAIM sentence:  He found it difficult to give clear advice on the level of damages that might be expected but put it within a range of ,-, or even slightly more

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, Mr Silverleaf reflected on what the papers told him about the quality of the defence filed by the News of the World, stating:  In the light of these facts, there is a powerful case that there is or was a culture of illegal information access used at NGN in order to produce stories for publication

CLAIM sentence:  Also on  June  Julian Pike, a partner at Farrer & Co, told Mr Taylors solicitors that NGN was about to make an offer of ,

CLAIM sentence:  He said that NGN were happy that this would not be beaten by the amount that might be awarded at trial, but that they were prepared to pay the higher amount in order to resolve the matter that week and on the basis that the deal would be confidential

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Pike then spoke to Mr Taylors solicitor, Mr Lewis, on  June 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Lewis indicated that Mr Taylor would want at least  million plus costs not to open his mouth

CLAIM sentence:  The report of the conversation made by Mr Pike shows a desire on the part of Mr Taylor to pursue the claim in order to demonstrate that voicemail interception was rife in the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately NGN settled with Mr Taylor for ,, of which , was attributed to damages and the balance to costs

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcinterception was not confined to Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  Those matters were: the content of counts  to  on the indictment; the fact that they were brought against Mr Mulcaire but not Mr Goodman; the fact that they related to victims who were of no apparent interest to a royal correspondent and the sentencing remarks of Gross J

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Chapman said that he had obtained a copy of the sentencing remarks at the request of Daniel Cloke, and on behalf of Mr Crone, but that he did not read them himself

CLAIM sentence:  There is no reason to doubt what Mr Myler says but, given the background and his own perception of the newsroom, this lack of interest is also remarkable

CLAIM sentence:  In short, Mr Crone and Mr Chapman were both clearly aware of the allegations made by Mr Goodman in his appeal against dismissal, but there is no evidence that they were known more widely

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler was also aware of them to the extent that they were demonstrated by the documents disclosed by the police for the purposes of the claim brought by Mr Taylor (these documents were also seen by Mr Crone)

CLAIM sentence:  The extent of James Murdochs knowledge of the allegations is not clear

CLAIM sentence:  There was a discussion between Mr Myler and James Murdoch of which neither participant claims to have a substantial recollection

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Pike made a note of a subsequent telephone conversation that he had with Mr Myler on  May , during which Mr Myler relayed to Mr Pike what he explained were the relevant points of his conversation with James Murdoch

CLAIM sentence:  The note is not straightforward to interpret

CLAIM sentence:  It makes reference to the fact that Mr Goodman sprayed around allegations but it is not clear whether that was a reference to what had been discussed with James Murdoch or to the beginning of a subsequent discussion between Mr Myler and Mr Pike

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch contended that the note of his conversation with Mr Myler did not go beyond recording his view that they should wait for the opinion of leading Counsel, which had already been sought

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch said in evidence that Mr Myler had not taken the opportunity to alert him to the fact that there were allegations that voicemail interception at the News of the World went wider than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  There is also a dispute about how high within the organisation the advice from Mr Silverleaf was seen

CLAIM sentence:  There is no doubt that Mr Crone read it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler said in evidence that he was told the gist of it but did not see the actual advice and was not told that Mr Silverleafs opinion was that there was a powerful case that there is or was a culture of illegal information access used at NGN in order to produce stories for publication

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch said that the opinion of Mr Silverleaf was mentioned to him but not shown to him (which he explains is not unusual as the Chief Executive), and that he was not told that there was new evidence that NGNs involvement in voicemail interception went beyond Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcclear is that, even following the unequivocal opinion of Mr Silverleaf, no action was taken to investigate whether there was a culture of obtaining information by unlawful means

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, the full focus of the management team was on handling the litigation and the potential reputational repercussions

CLAIM sentence:  On  June  Mr Myler forwarded an email chain to James Murdoch which made clear that Mr Taylor was asserting that unlawful information gathering techniques were rife within the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  The message from Mr Myler read: James, update on the Gordon Taylor Professional Football Association case

CLAIM sentence:  Unfortunately its as bad as we feared

CLAIM sentence:  The note from Julian Pike of Farrers is extremely telling regarding Taylors vindictiveness but again that speaks for itself

CLAIM sentence:  It would be helpful if Tom Crone and I could have five minutes with you on Tuesday

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch explained in evidence that he did not read all the email chain, and did not read the specific allegation made by Mr Taylor because he received the email on a Saturday when he was with his family

CLAIM sentence:  He said that since he was due to meet Mr Myler to discuss the issue on the following Tuesday he did not feel he needed to read beyond the request for a meeting

CLAIM sentence:  On  June , Mr Myler, Mr Crone and James Murdoch met to discuss the civil claim brought by Mr Taylor

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone said in evidence that he probably took with him copies of Mr Silverleafs opinion, the pleadings from the case, spare copies of the front page of the for Neville email and his earlier briefing note

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone was very clear that the for Neville email was discussed, and that James Murdoch was told that it was direct and hard evidence of involvement in voicemail interception beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler said that he did not have any useful recollection of what specifically was discussed at the meeting or what documents were discussed or shared

CLAIM sentence:  James Murdoch said in evidence that he was told at the meeting that there was evidence that linked the interception of Mr Taylors voicemail messages to the NoTW and that the case would certainly be lost and should be settled

CLAIM sentence:  His recollection was that Mr Crone and Mr Myler told him that counsels advice on the level of settlement was that: the number could be upwards of ,, so they said half a million to a million pounds with costs in it

CLAIM sentence:  He also stated that the discussion about the for Neville email was limited to the fact that it linked the NoTW to the interception of Mr Taylors voicemail messages and that there was no discussion about the fact that it suggested the involvement of other NoTW journalists

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcemail or the opinion of Mr Silverleaf, nor told that the opinion of Mr Silverleaf was that there was evidence that the practice of voicemail interception was used by journalists other than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  Rupert Murdoch said in evidence that he knew nothing of the settlement of the claim brought by Mr Taylor when it happened in 

CLAIM sentence:  He recalled discussing with James Murdoch why the settlement was so high, but denied that there was any discussion about the fact that Mr Taylor had evidence of further illegality at NoTW or that NGN had had to settle at that level to buy the silence of Mr Taylor

CLAIM sentence:  He said that James Murdochs explanation for the value of the settlement was that, though high, it was less than the anticipated cost of a full trial

CLAIM sentence:  Rupert Murdoch claimed that senior management at NI: were, all misinformed and shielded from anything that was going on there

CLAIM sentence:  theres no question in my mind that maybe even the editor, but certainly beyond that someone took charge of a cover-up which we were victim to

CLAIM sentence: was a clever lawyer and forbade people to go and report to Mrs Brooks or to James

CLAIM sentence:  Both Mr Myler and Mr Crone strongly denied that there was a culture of cover up at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Crone accepted that everyone hoped that it would all go away if it could be kept quiet, but contended that the thinking was not to cover up criminality but to avoid reputational damage through bad publicity

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler, similarly, said:  I dont believe it was a cover-up

CLAIM sentence: and I dont believe its wrong or unreasonable of any business to try to protect the reputation of itself, particularly after what had happened in the course of  and 

CLAIM sentence:  Whatever the truth of what was discussed on  June , the evidence outlined above points to a serious failure of governance within the NoTW, NI and News Corporation

CLAIM sentence:  Although I endorse the right of any business to seek to protect its reputation, it surely must first take every step to get to the bottom of what had happened

CLAIM sentence:  In any event, if the explanation of James and Rupert Murdoch is correct, far from simply limiting external damage to reputation, one or more parts of the management at the NoTW was engaged in a determined cover-up to keep relevant information about potential criminal activity within the organisation from senior management within NI

CLAIM sentence:  Having made that point, however, I must make it clear that if James Murdoch was unaware of the allegations, his lack of knowledge is, at least in part, only as a result of chance, rather than as the consequence of a sustained campaign by Mr Myler or Mr Crone (if there was one) deliberately to keep him in the dark

CLAIM sentence:  It is sufficient to say that if James Murdoch had been the victim of a cover-up, or an attempt to minimise the gravity of the position, then the accountability and governance systems at NI would have to be considered to have broken down in an extremely serious respect

CLAIM sentence:  If James Murdoch was not the victim of an internal cover up then the same criticism can be made of him as of Mr Myler or Mr Crone in respect of the failure to take appropriate action to deal with allegations of widespread criminality within the organisation

CLAIM sentence:  A similar analysis stands in respect of News Corporation

CLAIM sentence:  Although there is no evidence from which I could safely infer that Rupert Murdoch was aware of a wider problem, it does not appear that he followed up (or arranged for his son to follow up) on the brief that he believed had been given to Mr Myler to find out what the hell was going on, leaving the matter solely in the hands of Mr Hinton

CLAIM sentence:  If News Corporation management, and in particular Rupert Murdoch, were aware of the allegations, it is obvious that action should have been taken to investigate them

CLAIM sentence:  If News Corporation were not aware of the allegations which, as Rupert Murdoch has said, have cost the corporation many hundreds of millions of pounds, then there would appear to have been a significant failure in corporate governance and in particular in the effective identification and management of risks affecting NI and, thus, the corporation

CLAIM sentence:  I have given careful consideration as to whether I should go further, and conclude that Mr Crones version of events as to what occurred on  June  should be preferred to that of James Murdoch

CLAIM sentence:  There are aspects of the account of Mr Murdoch that cause me some concern: in particular, it is surprising if the gist of Mr Silverleafs opinion was not communicated to him in circumstances where the potential reputational damage to the company, of which he was CEO, was likely to be great if an early settlement of the claim brought by Mr Taylor were not achieved

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, Mr Myler and Mr Crone had no reason or motive to conceal relevant facts from the senior man, as borne out by the former sending James Murdoch the chain of emails containing the bad news on the afternoon of Saturday  June 

CLAIM sentence:  Not merely does this throw light on Mr Mylers state of mind on that date, it provides some indication as to what the agenda might have been for the meeting three days later

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, I also have serious concerns about the evidence of Mr Crone and Mr Myler about this meeting: given the significance of the issue, it is surprising that there was not a full blown risk analysis with options for James Murdoch to consider

CLAIM sentence:  After all, this litigation represented the first of a number of potential actions and there was, at the very least, a real risk that the problems were  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xc

CLAIM sentence:  In truth, at no stage, did anybody drill down into the facts to answer the myriad of questions that could have been asked and which could be encompassed by the all embracing question what the hell was going on? These questions included what Mr Mulcaire had been doing for such rewards and for whom?; what oversight had been exercised in relation to the use of his services?; why had Mr Goodman felt it justifiable to involve himself in phone hacking?; why had he argued that he should be able to return to employment and why was he being (or why had been) paid off

CLAIM sentence:  Although this conclusion might be parsimonious, it is more than sufficient to throw clear light on the culture, practices and ethics existing and operating at the News of the World at the material time

CLAIM sentence:  Those criminal methods were alleged to include using private investigators to intercept the mobile phone voicemail messages of numerous public figures, including cabinet ministers, MPs, actors and sportspeople

CLAIM sentence:  The article referred specifically to the claim brought by Gordon Taylor and stated: Today, the Guardian reveals details of the suppressed evidence which may open the door to hundreds more legal actions by victims of News Group, the Murdoch company that publishes the News of the World and the Sun, as well as provoking police inquiries into reporters who were involved and the senior executives responsible for them

CLAIM sentence:  The article referred to the assertion of NI, following the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, that it knew of no other journalist who was involved in voicemail interception and that Mr Goodman had been acting without its knowledge

CLAIM sentence:  police told the Guardian that during the Goodman inquiry, officers had found evidence of News Group staff using private investigators who hacked into thousands of mobile phones

CLAIM sentence:  Another source with direct knowledge of the police findings put the figure at two or three thousand mobiles

CLAIM sentence:  They suggest that MPs from all three parties and cabinet ministers, including former deputy prime minister John Prescott and former culture secretary Tessa Jowell, were among the targets 

CLAIM sentence:  The article referred to the fact that in the claim brought by Mr Taylor, the court had ordered the MPS to disclose evidence obtained during its investigation into Mr Goodman and then reported as follows:  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcThe Scotland Yard files included paperwork which revealed that, contrary to News Groups initial denial, Mulcaire had provided a recording of the messages on Taylors phone to a News of the World journalist who had transcribed them and emailed them to a senior reporter; and that a News of the World executive had offered Mulcaire a substantial bonus payment for a story specifically related to the intercepted messages

CLAIM sentence:  The article also reported that, faced with this evidence, NI began offering huge sums of money to Mr Taylor to settle the case and secure a confidentiality clause

CLAIM sentence:  They, too, filed complaints, which were settled earlier this year when News International paid a total of more than , in damages and costs on condition that they, too, signed gagging clauses

CLAIM sentence:  The Guardians understanding is that the paperwork disclosed by Scotland Yard to Taylor is only a fraction of the total material they gathered on News Groups involvement with Glenn Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  The Guardian had made a clear allegation that evidence implicating journalists other than Mr Goodman had already been obtained by the police during the original investigation

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence of James Murdoch was that the article was drawn to his attention and that he asked the management at the NoTW whether the allegation, that Mr Taylor had been paid, in effect, hush money, was true

CLAIM sentence:  He said that he was assured: That it wasnt true, that there was no other evidence, that there you know, this is a you know, this has been investigated to death and this is, you know, a smear

CLAIM sentence:  He made no effort to probe further and accordingly there was no investigation of the allegations

CLAIM sentence:  On the morning of  July , which was the day after the Guardian article appeared online but when it featured in the print edition of the newspaper, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, was being driven to an ACPO conference

CLAIM sentence:  It was quite frequently the case that he would hear something on the radio or read something in the newspaper and ask the matter to be looked into and he heard a discussion on the radio about the allegations made in the article

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul understood the allegation to be that the MPS had not gone the whole distance in the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He took it to be just yet another headline which he expected the Assistant Commissioner to pick up and deal with

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul and Mr Yates had the common understanding that Mr Yates was not expected to conduct a review of Operation Caryatid but to establish the facts surrounding the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  As Mr Yates stressed: The request was to establish the facts

CLAIM sentence:  An issue that arises immediately is whether it was appropriate for Mr Yates to conduct the exercise at all given the nature of his relationship with Neil Wallis

CLAIM sentence:  Needless to say Mr Wallis, as deputy editor of the NoTW, was someone who on the face of things fell within this latter category and there was therefore a risk that far from assuaging concern, should the nature of his friendship become public knowledge, Mr Yates would exacerbate it

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst there is no evidence to cause me to suspect that Mr Yates was, in fact, influenced in his decision-making by his friendship with Mr Wallis, I have no doubt that he should not have accepted the task nor maintained responsibility for considering subsequent allegations made in the press; particularly (as was the event), if he was to dismiss the concern, he risked creating a perception that the decision-making of the MPS was not independent or impartial, but influenced by his friendship

CLAIM sentence:  In response to the suggestion that he should not have undertaken the fact-finding exercise in the light of his relationship with Mr Wallis, Mr Yates said: from ,  onwards, whenever Caryatid started, there was never any question of Mr Wallis being involved

CLAIM sentence:  He hadnt resigned, he continued to work at the newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  There was no evidence in July  

CLAIM sentence:  So as far as we were aware, you had Mr Goodman, as a cog in a large organisation, arrested for wrongdoing and sent to prison

CLAIM sentence:  Leaving aside for the time being the misconception that there was no other evidence to suggest others involvement, in this response, Mr Yates missed the point

CLAIM sentence:  It was no answer to state that there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Wallis was involved in unlawful voicemail interception because the Guardian was claiming precisely that senior executives could be involved and that there was evidence that they were

CLAIM sentence:  On analysis, this response betrays a closed mind-set because it suggests that Mr Yates had already dismissed the very question he was being asked to consider, even if on a limited basis: namely whether the police held evidence of a conspiracy to intercept communications that went beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and which they should now be considering

CLAIM sentence:  Further, in this answer Mr Yates did not grapple with the fact that his friendship with Mr Wallis might create a perception that he would be influenced in his decision-making

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates continued: I completely take that as a perception, but what this was on July , , was a newspaper article

CLAIM sentence:  Newspaper articles, as we all know, can have basis in facts and they can have lots of flour put around them to make them more interesting

CLAIM sentence:  I can only go on what the evidence was that day and thats where I got to

CLAIM sentence:  In those answers Mr Yates failed to deal with the fundamental point that it could be perceived that he did not approach the exercise with a wholly objective mindset

CLAIM sentence:  He also appeared not to grasp that it mattered not at all whether he was aware of any evidence implicating Mr Wallis personally, not least because before he embarked on the fact-finding exercise he had no way of knowing what evidence Operation Caryatid had uncovered or what the alleged suppressed evidence comprised

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, after a number of questions on the point, he appeared to accept that there was at least the appearance of a lack of disinterestedness because of his close friendship with Mr Wallis, although he has since made clear that he denies that it was a misjudgement to undertake the exercise and that he does not accept even that there was a perception that the decision-making for which he was ultimately responsible was not independent and impartial

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates has also since argued that had the fact-finding exercise uncovered any hint of potential wrongdoing by Neil Wallis personally, then he would at that point have declared a conflict of interest and handed the exercise over to a colleague

CLAIM sentence:  During his evidence Mr Yates was understandably eager to stress that in reality his friendship with Mr Wallis had no bearing on his decision-making

CLAIM sentence:  He sought to reinforce this by emphasising that there were informal checks and balances

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates gave the example that it would be nonsense to suggest that an officer like DCS Surtees would accept a perverse decision just because Mr Yates was a senior officer

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst factors such as these support my conclusion that the decision-making of Mr Yates was not in fact distorted by his friendship with Mr Wallis, they would not have prevented the perception forming that it was, and that perception is capable of undermining public confidence in his decision

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates suggested that it could only be said that his decision to undertake the fact-finding exercise was wrong when viewed with hindsight, informed by knowledge of the cover-up undertaken by News International

CLAIM sentence:  I also observe that the position of Mr Yates was internally inconsistent

CLAIM sentence:  If it was sufficiently important for him to deal with, he ought to have raised with the Deputy Commissioner, Tim Godwin, or Sir Paul Stephenson whether it would be better if someone else undertake the exercise because the deputy editor of the NoTW was his friend

CLAIM sentence:  I conclude this discussion by making clear that I do not suggest that, in reality, he approached the task with anything other than complete integrity and in good faith

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul believes that Mr Yates did not give thought to whether there was a conflict of interest because of a defensive mindset: I suspect that defensive mindset set in very early, for all the reasons I outline, that stopped us challenging ourselves, that stopped us going back and challenging what was the reason for the original investigation stopping short, albeit we didnt know it stopped short

CLAIM sentence:  I think that is the more likely reason why Mr Yates didnt decide that he had a conflict or not

CLAIM sentence:  It is certainly a plausible explanation

CLAIM sentence:  Fully articulated (as put by Mr Rhodri Davies QC in his closing address for NI) it is that Mr Yates (and indeed DCS Williams) did not interpret the Guardians article as a non-judgmental suggestion that the practice of voicemail interception merited another look

CLAIM sentence:  Rather, he saw it as an unjustified attack on the integrity of the  investigation that it did not occur to him to consider whether it was appropriate for him to carry out the exercise

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, this latter question did not subsequently strike him because he made up his mind within the space of what can only have been a few hours that there was no need to look further and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy, least of all one involving Mr Wallis

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that Sir Paul knew that Mr Yates was a friend of Mr Wallis (although he said that he did not know the extent of the friendship)

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul very frankly admitted that he did not make the connection

CLAIM sentence:  When it was suggested to him that it might have been inappropriate for Mr Yates carry out the exercise, he said: I think youre crediting me with a level of analysis that I wouldnt and didnt give to this matter

CLAIM sentence:  It was just another headline, a sort of I dont mean to say this dismissively some noise about an event that I expected someone to pick up and deal with I didnt connect it with Mr Wallis

CLAIM sentence:  It does not seem, however, that Sir Paul would have acted differently even if he had made the connection between Mr Wallis and the allegations made by the Guardian

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul said in evidence that: Had [Mr Yates] come back to me with this I might have expected him to get somebody within his business group to deal with it and ensure there could be no allegations of impropriety against him

CLAIM sentence:  I do have to say this is hypothesis and were speculating just a little, sir that probably Mr Yates would have felt that he was more than equipped to deal with it

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul was challenged on his evidence that chief constables and senior officers investigate people known to them socially and who have been friends

CLAIM sentence:  There are strict rules about conflicts of interest of this type (including the maintenance of relationships with those who are under investigation) and I do not anticipate for one moment that Sir Paul was distancing himself from those rules

CLAIM sentence:  The fact-finding exercise I turn now to the exercise that was conducted to find the facts, which Mr Yates started and on which he announced his conclusion all within the same day as the article had appeared in print, namely  July 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates explained that he received informal briefings about the investigation before he chaired a Gold Group meeting at :hrs: this was a formal meeting to discuss facts and record decisions

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates said that numerous people who had worked on the enquiry at various levels were involved, including DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and D/Supt Southworth

CLAIM sentence:  According to DCS Williams, he was with Mr Yates for most of the day, explaining to him what the police had done during the original investigation

CLAIM sentence:  The documents shown to Mr Yates were the strategy for informing potential victims, a copy of the indictment and a short briefing document

CLAIM sentence:  There were three problems with the process that was adopted on that day

CLAIM sentence:  The first and fundamental problem was that none of the officers, including DCS Williams, who had overall responsibility for briefing Mr Yates, were given any real opportunity to refresh their memory of the nuances of what had been a comparatively complex investigation, involving seizure of a vast quantity of material, difficult issues of law and the overwhelmingly important competing demands consequent upon the threat of terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates did not wait for the documents (including the decision log) to be retrieved from storage, leaving DCS Williams with access only to the memories of the officers available to discuss the investigation and to very limited documentation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates has submitted that before he reached any conclusions he ensured that DCS Williams and senior members of his team had satisfied him that they had a full recollection of all salient points of the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  It was, however, quite unrealistic of Mr Yates to expect that the officers could do so in such a short time, even if they believed they could

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes of the Gold Group meeting indicate that Mr Yates approached the task by asking some perceptive questions

CLAIM sentence:  Further, in answer to the question: What other journalists were involved? Mr Yates was told: There was no evidence at that time to implicate involvement in [sic] any other journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Under the heading Reopening of investigation it was written: No evidence to justify

CLAIM sentence:  In all likelihood it was DCS Williams who gave these answers and communicated this message to Mr Yates because it appears  pp-, lines -, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Leaving aside the question of whether the evidence uncovered by Operation Caryatid ought properly to be labelled as direct, circumstantial or inferential evidence, it is important to note from the outset that the message communicated to Mr Yates was not that there was some evidence that the criminality extended beyond Mr Goodman, but that there had been insufficient evidence to prosecute other journalists (which, as I have found, was the understanding, in , of the officers involved in Operation Caryatid, including DCS Williams)

CLAIM sentence:  It is quite likely that this initial briefing provided the prism through which Mr Yates viewed the information he was given in subsequent oral and written briefings

CLAIM sentence:  The more recent explanation provides the context in these terms: In the months following the arrest and right up to the prosecution DAC Clarkes decision to continue within the parameters as originally set and thereby not go any further in terms of the material seized from Mulcaire and Goodman, remained

CLAIM sentence:  My understanding of this enduring rationale was that this would have involved a commitment of huge resources that could not be justified given the climate concerning, in particular, terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  It is worth adding, in parenthesis, that even if Mr Yates had waited for the records to be unearthed, he would not have found a record of the briefing given to Mr Clarke at the end of September  or of the rationale behind the ultimate decision not to expand the investigation beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire because there was no such record

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to the absence of the record, the MPS submits that although the specific reasons were not set out in any detail, given the successful and widely reported charging and subsequent public prosecutions of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire together with the  para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS also submits that the lack of recorded reasons did not have any material impact on the  decision, as the same officers who conducted the original investigation also provided detailed briefings and advised Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  Although true, the fact is that neither DCS Williams nor any other officer who spoke to Mr Yates on  July did, apparently, recall accurately why the decision was made by Mr Clarke and so did not provide a full picture for Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  He goes on to argue that Mr Yates knew why the operation had been closed down, but I have seen no evidence that Mr Yates was ever told, in terms which would have been sufficiently clear to correct the initial understanding he was given (that there was no evidence to expand the investigation wider), that Mr Clarke made the decision essentially on the basis of the necessary prioritisation of counter terrorism investigations so that his decision said little if anything about the quality of the evidence or viability of the leads

CLAIM sentence:  The fact remains that the rationale was not explained adequately to Mr Yates and a clearly recorded decision setting out the rationale would, in all likelihood, have avoided the misunderstanding that clearly arose

CLAIM sentence:  Suffice to say, I have little doubt that the answers given on  July to the questions posed by Mr Yates caused him to misunderstand the scope of what had been revealed during Operation Caryatid and to go on to approach the exercise from entirely the wrong angle, that is to say focusing exclusively on the question of whether the Guardian article had revealed any evidence that the police had not previously seen

CLAIM sentence:  The second problem was that Mr Yates did not approach the exercise with any intellectual rigour or scrutinise the information he was given

CLAIM sentence:  As explained above, crucially, Mr Yates pursued only the question whether anything was new: he did not pursue the questions which the article raised

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear from the minutes of the Gold Group that Mr Yates was informed that a large amount of material had been seized

CLAIM sentence:  Had the material seized from Mr Mulcaire all been analysed and, if not, why not? What was the basis of the decision to limit the indictment as drafted and (in relation to the counts on the indictment which it was not suggested involved Mr Goodman) to whom was Mr Mulcaire supplying that information and why? Who had caused Mr Mulcaire to obtain so many mobile phone numbers, PIN details and other material which, on the face of it, could give rise to the inference that he was seeking to get information by intercepting voicemail messages? Was it right that not all possible charges were pursued against News Group personnel? Was there any material to suggest that other  In a different sense, it may have made less significance because DCS Williams has maintained at all stages what I have concluded is his mischaracterisation of the material gathered during Operation Caryatid as amounting to no evidence that journalists other than Mr Goodman were involved in a conspiracy to intercept communications

CLAIM sentence:  It would still have been wrong not only because of the identified contraventions of the Computer Misuse Act  but also the inchoate offences of conspiracy and the fact that the indictment had not proceeded on the narrow view of the law  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcreporters were involved? It does not appear that any detailed consideration was (or, indeed, could have been) given to the substance of what was being alleged

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates wrote himself a file note on  July (or within  hours), in which he recorded the Principles to be adopted regarding Operation Caryatid and request by Commissioner to establish the facts around the case

CLAIM sentence:  Had Mr Yates explored properly these headlines, which he set for himself, he would (or should) have ascertained the true factual position, namely, that the police held vast quantities of documents that had not been analysed and very few of which had been reviewed or considered by the CPS or Counsel (save only for the very limited purpose of disclosing unused material)

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, Mr Yates appears to have accepted at face value the information provided by DCS Williams, relying only on his memory

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates was asked to what extent he tested the proposition that there was no evidence to implicate other journalists

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates replied that he would have asked whether counsel and the CPS saw the evidence and whether the unused material was reviewed properly

CLAIM sentence:  In explaining his limited approach, Mr Yates relied on the fact that he was not briefed that there was circumstantial or indeed other evidence which implicated journalists other than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams has accepted that the initial briefings he gave Mr Yates were not as thorough as he would have liked and were conducted from memory, without the benefit of documents, all as part of a hurried response to the Guardian article

CLAIM sentence:  It is undeniable that if DCS Williams along with his team of officers had been able to recreate for Mr Yates the much more nuanced state of the investigation and the context within which operational decisions had been taken, Mr Yates would have been in a better position to consider the matter and is unlikely to have publicly expressed himself on  July as he did

CLAIM sentence:  I also accept the general principle that it is essential to the efficient functioning of the MPS that a senior officer is able to rely on the total accuracy of the information given to him by officers under his command, and I do not doubt that DCS Williams intended to brief Mr Yates entirely accurately

CLAIM sentence:  However, these matters are by no means a complete answer for Mr Yates because he had to ensure that he had elicited all material facts from DCS Williams before relying on the latters assessment of those facts

CLAIM sentence:  Given the very specific allegations made by the Guardian, Mr Yates should have required DCS Williams to explain precisely what had been discovered that could potentially implicate journalists other than Mr Goodman, whatever the quality of the information (giving sufficient time to review the material gathered, perhaps  p, lines -, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates, as the senior officer in charge of deciding what the response of the organisation to the Guardian article should be, ought then to have considered for himself whether there were evidential leads and whether there ought to be a scoping exercise with a view to deciding whether the full investigation should be re-opened

CLAIM sentence:  Further, Mr Yates not only failed to require a more measured review of the position but he positively refused to allow it to happen before announcing his conclusions

CLAIM sentence:  This need not have taken a great deal of time but Mr Yates decided upon a very speedy response rather than mature reflection

CLAIM sentence:  By not establishing accurately all the relevant facts, Mr Yates proceeded on the false assumption that there was no material in police possession that could justify reconsideration of Operation Caryatid; thereafter, the only question of any interest to Mr Yates was whether the Guardian article revealed any new evidence

CLAIM sentence:  This, then, is the third problem with the exercise that was undertaken on  July

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes of the Gold Group meeting indicate that it was clearly decided at an early stage that there was no evidence to justify reopening the investigation: almost immediately, Mr Yates (and DCS Williams) had decided to dismiss the Guardian article in its entirety

CLAIM sentence:  The final action point was for the Directorate of Public Affairs to prepare press lines for Mr Yates to deliver to camera outside New Scotland Yard that afternoon

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Blair expressed the same view in evidence: From what I can see, that decision was just too quick

CLAIM sentence:  The result was that, on the afternoon of the day of the Guardian article, Mr Yates issued a press release publishing his conclusion that no additional evidence had come to light since the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, and therefore that no further investigation was required

CLAIM sentence:  In the press release Mr Yates stated that: This case has been subject of the most careful investigation by very experienced detectives

CLAIM sentence:  It suggested that the material seized from Mr Mulcaire had been thoroughly  p, lines -, Lord Blair, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates has claimed that DCS Williams assured him that counsel had spent two days reviewing the material and that no additional suspects had been identified

CLAIM sentence:  Indeed, as explained below, if such an exercise had taken place, it could not have been concluded within two days

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clarke and DCS Williams have explained that given the nature of the material (which included hundreds of unstructured handwritten pages), it was not a question of reading what had been seized from start to finish

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates would have known that any review of unused material for the purposes of identifying exculpatory material would not even have approached such an involved exercise

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to recognise that our enquiries showed that in the vast majority of cases there was insufficient evidence to show that tapping had actually been achieved

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes of the Gold Group meeting demonstrate that Mr Yates was briefed as follows:  names During searches of defendants premises, large amount of material seized, names, numbers etc

CLAIM sentence:  One defendant was a private investigator and as they had accessed mobile phone company systems, they had interest and potentially access to numerous people/phones

CLAIM sentence:  There was no evidence to prove criminally any other persons phone had been intercepted

CLAIM sentence:  It is surprising that DCS Williams appears to have briefed Mr Yates that others were not informed on the basis there was no evidence to suggest that there was any criminality in relation to their mobile phones, because the victim notification strategy, which DCS Williams had to hand that day, had been designed to ensure that large numbers of potential victims were informed because the only criterion was that the suspect numbers had dialled their unique voicemail access number

CLAIM sentence:  It is noteworthy that, on  February , when he signed his witness statement, Mr Yates apparently still believed that there was no unlawful interception unless it could be proved  p, lines -, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The important questions that arise from this analysis of events are: (a) why Mr Yates carried out this exercise in such a hurried way, without any proper consideration of the serious allegations made by the Guardian; (b) why DCS Williams was prepared to brief Mr Yates in unqualified terms without refreshing his memory fully from the decision logs and case papers and did so inaccurately; (c) why, within a matter of hours of the Guardian article, both men decided to dismiss the (d) article in its entirety; and to what extent, if at all, can the matters of concern in (a) to (c) above be explained by the relationships Mr Yates enjoyed with individuals at NI or the relationship more generally between the MPS and NI

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates provided an important insight into the level of respect he had for the allegations during his evidence when he said: This was a simple exercise and one of a number of exercises that the Commissioner or Deputy would ask ACs like me to do almost on a weekly basis

CLAIM sentence:  So the fact that I sort of cleared my diary and did something relatively formal around this, recognising some of the challenges, is actually qualitatively different than many times youd do it

CLAIM sentence:  So its what it was

CLAIM sentence:  Further, when asked whether the issues raised by the Guardian were wide-ranging, serious and important Mr Yates said: One looks at the invasion of privacy uncovered by Motorman and Glade and the sentences they got there, which was conditional discharges, so I would not put it at the serious end

CLAIM sentence:  What we know now puts it at the very serious end, but in July  it was phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  I was three months into a new job as head of anti-terrorism, we were dealing with the fall-out of a very difficult operation up in Manchester, which was still going, numerous other high-profile operations involving the security of the state

CLAIM sentence:  This did not present itself as a hugely serious thing in 

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst Mr Yates cannot be criticised for judging the relative seriousness of voicemail interception as markedly less grave than terrorism, this expression of his thinking reinforces the view that he did not apply himself fully to the task

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates has since added that it is relevant context that he was pressed with challenging work in relation to the ongoing fight against terrorism and the numerous high priority operations in progress

CLAIM sentence:  I do not challenge  pp-, paras  and , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Regarding the defensive facet of the attitude assumed by Mr Yates, Sir Paul Stephenson offered the following view why the decision not to reopen the investigation was made and maintained: I think that what happened in  is that within the Met, we developed a fixed mindset and a defensive mindset around this whole issue I think that mindset was based on a number of issues, none of which are an excuse as to why we didnt get this thing right I think the start of that mindset was very much about: its inconceivable for people in  to believe that an inquiry led by Mr Clarke would limit itself for any improper purposes I think after that, in the absence of [establishing] what the Met had in its possession I think thats been rehearsed in this Inquiry and in various places

CLAIM sentence:  It is worthwhile to add that Lord Blair commented: But I am clear, and Im quite prepared to say it, that was a decision that appears too hasty, and I thought some of the way in which Sir Paul Stephenson suggested the closed mindset of because it had been Peter Clarke who had made the decision and he was so respected, it was a very interesting piece of what you can describe sometimes as group think

CLAIM sentence:  I find that this defensive attitude was an important factor in explaining the approach taken by Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  The limited respect Mr Yates had for the allegations by virtue of the fact that they appeared in a newspaper combined with his belief (albeit justified) in the absolute integrity of the  investigation, no doubt largely because Mr Clarke had been at its helm, translated into a real reluctance to challenge or revisit past decisions

CLAIM sentence:  It resulted in a swift and offensive response, as described, accurately in my judgment, by Mr Rhodri Davies QC in his closing address

CLAIM sentence:  I must make it clear, however, that I do not find that there is any evidence from which to infer that any relationships with NI in general, or Neil Wallis in particular, contributed to this attitude or approach

CLAIM sentence:  It is undeniable that Mr Yates demonstrated poor judgment in failing to have sufficient respect for the allegations made in the Guardian article

CLAIM sentence:  I also find it significant that Sir Paul Stephenson (who had only heard about the article on the radio) thought it raised sufficiently important issues that he wanted an officer as senior as Mr Yates to look at it

CLAIM sentence:  It was unacceptable to treat it in the way that Mr Yates did; it was not the same as any article in a newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  It both demanded and merited a more considered and careful response as the reputational damage to the MPS has since amply demonstrated

CLAIM sentence:  In short, being open-minded meant that the allegations in the Guardian could not be dismissed within hours and DCS Williams should have appreciated that Mr Yates (who was entitled to rely on him) was doing just that (albeit without probing sufficiently or making sure that he understood all the ramifications of what had happened three years earlier)

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that I deal with the further allegation that DCS Williams sought to persuade Mr Yates not to reopen the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  This was refuted by DCS Williams, who said: I just gave an explanation of exactly what wed done and the position we had reached

CLAIM sentence:  I asked DCS Williams to explain why he presented to Mr Yates that there was nothing else to do when in  p, lines -, Philip Williams, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The effect of the passage of time, with numerous intervening investigations, combined with the defensiveness alluded to are a potential explanation, but for the purposes of the Terms of Reference, it is sufficient if I make it clear that I accept that DCS Williams was acting in good faith and I do not believe that he intended to mislead Mr Yates or that his approach was calculated to prevent the investigation being re-opened, whether to protect NI or any other improper purpose

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates was right to conclude that the Guardian had not revealed anything that would be new to the police, but that was precisely the point

CLAIM sentence:  What Mr Yates failed to recognise was that whether the Guardian had referred to new material was not the same question as whether re-opening the investigation might be warranted

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates had also said: If you look at the list of people who were present at that meeting, all very senior, all very experienced

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates ought to have known that it was not safe categorically to state that there was nothing to warrant any reconsideration of the investigation, or to rely on the lack of contradiction by anyone present at the meeting, in circumstances where no one involved in the investigation had had proper opportunity to refresh their memories from the decision logs and case papers

CLAIM sentence:  It is remarkable that, even with hindsight, Mr Yates was not prepared to accept that, on  July , it would have been more accurate to have said that there may well have been evidence which implicated others, but that the decision was taken in September  to limit the investigation because such evidence was insufficiently clear and operational demands required use of resources to deal with other, far more pressing, counter terrorism work

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates was asked, directly, whether it was his opinion that there was no evidence at all to suggest that others might be involved, he said: Well, there was the you know, the long spoken about for Neville email, which again was covered in terms of what its value to an investigation was on several occasions, not least by the DPP and counsel in terms of what it would value its evidential value

CLAIM sentence:  There was nothing else that we knew differently then

CLAIM sentence:  He also said: There was certainly a desire to go to the phone hubs and all that

CLAIM sentence:  The evidential challenges were paramount, and as far as I was aware from them were completely that they could not be overcome

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates said that he did recall the phrase a sort of Mexican stand-off at Wapping HQ but that: I think the newspaper lawyers would want to test that warrant and do everything they could do to safeguard journalistic material

CLAIM sentence:  I wouldnt necessarily think that would be an unusual turn of events at a newspaper

CLAIM sentence:  It was put to him that this was part of the inferential picture of whether there was evidence generally speaking against others at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates appears to have adopted without challenge, and maintained, the same mistaken appraisal of the state of the evidence as DCS Williams, namely that Operation Caryatid had disclosed no evidence that journalists other than Mr Goodman had been involved in unlawful voicemail interception and had produced no viable leads

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates contended that lawyers and police officers have different opinions as to what might constitute evidence for these purposes

CLAIM sentence:  Apparently Mr Yates continued to fail to recognise that there was material in police possession that was capable of being taken forward

CLAIM sentence:  Although it is right that Mr Yates cannot have known the extent of the wrongdoing at the NoTW, or the extent to which it had been concealed, he undoubtedly did not require the benefit of hindsight to respond adequately to the Guardian article by identifying the reason why Operation Caryatid had not exhaustively pursued all possible leads, by discerning that there were parts of the Guardian article that generated concern and by taking rather longer to consider the position than he was prepared to devote to it

CLAIM sentence:  The error of judgment in deciding on immediate and prompt dismissal of the allegations by press announcement that afternoon should have been apparent at the time

CLAIM sentence:  It has been argued that I should not reach adverse conclusions without having heard from Carmen Dowd

CLAIM sentence:  For instance, Mr Yates has submitted that it was the advice she gave in  that influenced his approach to what was achievable given the limited resources available

CLAIM sentence:  The problem facing the police team in , however, was not the advice in 

CLAIM sentence:  It was that it was known that there was an enormous body of evidence which had not been examined, yet it was decided that there would be no further consideration of the allegations unless there was new evidence; it would only have been at that stage, when deciding what steps to take in the light of the new evidence that Mr Yates would have considered resourcing priorities

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, I must deal with two other aspects of the press release issued by Mr Yates on  July 

CLAIM sentence:  The first concerns the Deputy Prime Minister and asserts: There has been a lot of media comment today about the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott

CLAIM sentence:  This investigation has not uncovered any evidence to suggest that John Prescotts phone had been tapped

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Prescott had written to Sir Paul Stephenson asking whether the Guardian had been correct to allege that the MPS held the names of all those whose phones were targeted, including his, and if so, why the police did not inform those people or take any action

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates had also telephoned  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  It is extraordinary that Mr Yates was prepared to give this assurance both to Lord Prescott personally and in his press release because it is clear from the minutes of the Gold Group meeting that DCS Williams was not able to state definitively that Lord Prescott was not a potential victim

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes suggest therefore that the assurance given by Mr Yates to Lord Prescott was based on nothing but an assumption on the part of DCS Williams, which he had not had time to confirm, that Lord Prescott could not have been a potential victim because if he had been, he would have been informed pursuant to the victim notification strategy

CLAIM sentence:  This is despite the fact that DCS Williams did not oversee the strategy to make sure that it had been executed as intended and, given that it was not in fact overseen by anyone else, DCS Williams could have received no confirmation that it had been put fully into effect

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams has raised in submissions that in a written briefing to Mr Yates, dated  July , a DCS Timmons stated the following: Deputy PM John Prescott PW and KS without reference to the exact documentation believe that Mr Prescott was not directly targeted although it is believed that members of his staff may have been

CLAIM sentence:  There has been no direct contact with Mr Prescott and he is not believed on the information available at this time that he was a victim of interception

CLAIM sentence:  If this briefing note accurately reflects the position, then it gives a different or additional explanation for why he reassured Mr Yates that Lord Prescott was not a potential victim of voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams has submitted that at that time, the view of what constituted interception was narrower

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees has also submitted that Mr Yates accepted the narrow interpretation of victim and that up until  everyone was working on that interpretation

CLAIM sentence:  This all indicates that DCS Williams and DCS Surtees, were briefing Mr Yates on the basis that an individual was only a victim if the police could prove that there had been an interception according to the narrow interpretation of s RIPA

CLAIM sentence:  The following day, after DCS Williams had apparently checked the position, he told Mr Yates that Lord Prescott had not been the subject of voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  Either DCS Williams gave Mr Yates this reassurance on the artificially narrow basis that a person could only be a victim (or potential victim) if voicemail messages left on his or her own phone had been intercepted, rather than voicemail messages received by people close to him/her, or, if this was not his approach, he gave the reassurance without checking the case papers because if he had carried out a reasonably careful review of the case papers he would have ascertained: (a) either from the papers seized from Mr Mulcaire or from the record of interview of Mr Mulcaire on  August  at : hrs, that Mr Mulcaire had recorded in his papers the name, John Prescott, with advisor and then Joan Hammel underneath and her  p, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Precisely what happened and the exact thinking of Mr Yates and DCS Williams on this issue could not be explored without recalling the witnesses and delaying this Report

CLAIM sentence:  The second aspect of the press statement which requires further consideration is that Mr Yates stated that the MPS was taking all proper steps to ensure that, where there was evidence that people had been the subject of voicemail interception or there was any suspicion that there may have been, that they had been informed

CLAIM sentence:  Keir Starmer QC, who had succeeded Lord Macdonald as the DPP, was concerned by the assertions made in the Guardian, in particular the claim that deliberate decisions had been taken not to prosecute NoTW executives (which could have involved his staff)

CLAIM sentence:  In contrast to Mr Yates, Mr Starmer explained that he took the Guardian article seriously both because of the important issue it raised and because of the number and seriousness of the requests coming in to him that day

CLAIM sentence:  They persuaded him that this was something he really needed to understand and that he needed to reconstruct the picture as quickly as possible

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer became aware of the press statement that Mr Yates gave later that afternoon

CLAIM sentence:  At that stage, however, he did not know how little time Mr Yates had devoted to his establishment of the facts exercise

CLAIM sentence:  Later that same evening ( July ) Mr Starmer issued his own press statement in the following terms: I have no reason to consider that there was anything inappropriate in the prosecutions that were undertaken in this case

CLAIM sentence:  Again, in direct contrast to the approach taken by Mr Yates, in his press release Mr Starmer gave a provisional indication but reserved his position until a thorough examination had been conducted

CLAIM sentence:  It is important to appreciate that Mr Starmer intended that this exercise should be limited: the examination was confined to the material that the police had physically supplied to the CPS and not the unused material, because reviewing the unused material would have been an extensive and time consuming task

CLAIM sentence:  This was a reasonable approach and the fact that Mr Starmer wanted some time taken over it also demonstrates a difference from the line taken by the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  As it happened, however, due to a misunderstanding, the team at the CPS did not examine the entirety of the evidence in their possession

CLAIM sentence:  Unlike the police (where all the relevant officers, save for Mr Clarke, continued in service), the CPS in general and Mr Starmer in particular were hampered by the fact that Lord Macdonald was no longer in post and Ms Carmen Dowd had left the service

CLAIM sentence:  Throughout  and , Simon Clements, the new Head of Special Crime Division, was responsible for briefing Mr Starmer on issues relating to voicemail interception although he had not been involved  p, lines -, ibid  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Accordingly, the CPS was reliant, perhaps over-reliant, on what the MPS told it about the events of those years

CLAIM sentence:  The paucity of material available to the CPS at this early stage is demonstrated by the notes of a conference which took place with junior counsel, Mr Mably, on  July 

CLAIM sentence:  The principal point which he remembered was the need to ring fence the investigation in order to avoid personal embarrassment to Princes William and Harry

CLAIM sentence:  Unsurprisingly, he could not recall any of the fine detail of the case

CLAIM sentence:  As if again to underline that this was not simply just another article, the  July  also saw the Chairman of the Culture Media and Sports Committee (CMS) write to Sir Paul Stephenson, asking him to submit written evidence to the Committee concerning the investigation into voicemail interception

CLAIM sentence:  The following day,  July , Mr Yates convened and chaired a second Gold Group meeting to seek update from yesterdays meeting

CLAIM sentence:  The following is recorded in the minutes: The original enquiry team (Op Caryatid) were aware that the defendant Glenn Mulcaire was speaking to numerous people and other journalists to the very nature of his job

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS sent a letter to News of the World asking them to reveal the phone numbers for their journalists so a comparison could be made on the seized data

CLAIM sentence:  It appeared [Mr Mulcaire] often used the News of the World switchboard so it was difficult to confirm who he was speaking with

CLAIM sentence:  Telephone data went into , + and although further analysis could have been conducted to identify other journalists etc, it was decided in conjunction with CPS / Counsel, to set parameters and from a proportionality point of view, to focus on evidence that would support charges and attract suitable penalty at court for the level of criminality involved

CLAIM sentence:  If the MPS were to consider extending remit now then the phone companies no longer hold the data so it would not be feasible to investigate

CLAIM sentence:  [DCS Surtees] stated that during the S searches of News International the Police team met resistance and threats to use force to remove them from the premises

CLAIM sentence:  These discussions brought to the attention of Mr Yates that evidence gathered did indicate that other journalists might be involved and that further analysis of the telephone data could have been conducted to identify other journalists, but that no analysis was conducted for reasons of proportionality

CLAIM sentence:  They also flagged to Mr Yates the strong resistance from NI to the search

CLAIM sentence:  They did not, however, cause Mr Yates to review his decision of the previous day

CLAIM sentence:  Even if Mr Yates did absorb that there was in fact evidence that might implicate other journalists,  Not published  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  This entrenched position is relevant when considering the protestations made by Mr Yates that it was not just an eight-hour exercise, but a continuing exercise of reviewing, considering, reflecting about, you know, whether we were on the right track and whether we needed to do something different

CLAIM sentence:  In my judgment, given the emphatic and publicly announced response on the previous day, to the extent that there was a continuing review at all, it was extremely focused, wrongly demanding nothing short of new evidence before consideration would be given to reopening the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He accepted that after  July he did not continue with the establishment of the facts exercise

CLAIM sentence:  His evidence was that the continuing exercise was to do with all about the victims, actually, all about the victims

CLAIM sentence:  He states that he challenged Mr Yates and even suggested that Her Majestys Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) should be appointed to investigate

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams, in his further evidence, agrees that DCS Surtees was quite vociferous, at his first meeting with Mr Yates in suggesting that he review or reopen the investigation or that HMIC have an independent look at it

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Surtees was not asked about  when the evidence was called and Mr Yates has not been asked to respond to what is now said

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances, as a matter of fairness, I am not prepared to reach any conclusion on this issue

CLAIM sentence:  By  July, however, the scene had been set both by the briefing given by DCS Williams and the press announcement of the previous day: it would have required considerably more than DCS Surtees calling for a review to persuade Mr Yates to alter the course he had fixed in place

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, to be fair to Mr Yates, it is right to note that in the briefing note to which DCS Surtees contributed, dated  July , and considered below, the evidence was not represented in a way that steered the reader to the conclusion that there were viable leads

CLAIM sentence:  In that article, Mr Hayman claimed that the original investigation had left no stone unturned and that if there had been the slightest hint that others were involved, they would have been investigated

CLAIM sentence:  These were extraordinary assertions to make given the true scope of the investigation and given that Mr Hayman was not in a position to comment on the thoroughness or otherwise of the investigation because he was not aware of any of the details

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hayman said that he based his article on his general broad recollection, of how events were

CLAIM sentence:  I am satisfied that Mr Hayman was not deliberately intending to mislead and neither do I consider it to be proved that he was motivated by a desire to protect NI from further investigation; unwisely, however, he made defensive assertions which were based not on fact but on his assumption that the investigation would have been comprehensive

CLAIM sentence:  He undoubtedly believed the detectives working on Operation Caryatid to be tenacious investigators and that they would have sought to prosecute all offenders against whom there was a sufficiently strong case

CLAIM sentence:  In reality, without the relevant information, he set about defending the investigation (and, by extension, both himself and his former colleagues)

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, it was equally imprudent of Mr Hayman to write this article in The Times because, by doing so, he gave the impression, no doubt inadvertently but undeniably, that he was being deployed by NI to give support to the police line which, itself, was in support of NI

CLAIM sentence:  As referred to above, on  July , DCS Williams and DCS Surtees prepared a written briefing note for Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams and DCS Surtees stated the following in that note:  It is clear from these documents that Mulcaire had been engaged in a sustained (years) period of research work in various levels of completion

CLAIM sentence:  In many there is simply the name of a celebrity or well known figure in others there is more detail with names, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, DDNs passwords, PIN numbers and scribblings of private information

CLAIM sentence:  It should be noted that no evidence existed to suggest that those possible journalists detailed on these sheets had knowledge of the illegal methods undertaken to supply these stories, however, it should be pointed out that in one of the recordings recovered from Mulcaire it is clear Mulcaire is giving instruction to an unknown person (possibly a journalist) on the telephone, on how to access messages of Gordon Taylor

CLAIM sentence:  (As yet unconfirmed who this person is)

CLAIM sentence:  Also recovered were a number of contracts between Mulcaire and the News of the World, some show agreements to pay Mulcaire a wage of , per year In addition to these contracts other financial documents recovered highlighted individual payments to Mulcaire from the NOTW for instance in the case of Gordon Taylor an agreement to pay  once a story had been printed

CLAIM sentence:  The content of this briefing note leads me to the conclusion that even when DCS Williams had reviewed the investigation papers, his aim when briefing Mr Yates was only to reinforce the position that there was no evidence; that is not surprising given the view that he continues to maintain and, additionally, the fact that three days earlier Mr Yates had announced that there was nothing new to consider

CLAIM sentence:  The conclusion reached on the value of the corner names, at paragraph  of the note, appears to have been infected with the inaccurate analysis that there was no evidence that those identifiable by the corner names knew that Mr Mulcaire was obtaining the information unlawfully (when in fact there was circumstantial or inferential evidence of the same)

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear that the note conveyed that the officers suspected that the criminality went far beyond just Mr Goodman, but it did not convey any belief that there was material that could be developed in a wider investigation

CLAIM sentence:  It is evident that this briefing note introduced Mr Yates to evidence implicating other journalists, albeit the evidence was not given the epithet: corner names

CLAIM sentence:  It is right that the evidence was immediately followed by the assertion that no evidence existed that those journalists knew of the illegal methods used by Mr Mulcaire, but it gave Mr Yates the scintilla of evidence that he had protested he did not have

CLAIM sentence:  During his evidence Mr Yates said that he did not know about the corner names

CLAIM sentence:  That said, during his evidence, he did not accept that there was in fact any evidence that those named knew of the particular method of obtaining the information used by Mr Mulcaire: who knows what techniques, lawful or unlawful, private detectives use and how they get the information, you know, I cant be the judge

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates, like DCS Williams (and in the briefing note of  July  at least, DCS Surtees), has failed to acknowledge the circumstantial or inferential evidential value of the corner names or to consider how the communications between journalists and Mr Mulcaire might have come about or how the information which Mr Mulcaire obtained might have been passed back to the journalist

CLAIM sentence:  It might be that the officers intended to convey this to Mr Yates, but it would have been entirely reasonable for Mr Yates to interpret the reference to no evidence not as meaning insufficient to prosecute but that there was no evidence capable of being developed  This is whether or not the reference to no evidence was no sufficient evidence to prosecute as opposed to no evidence capable of being developed  p, lines -, John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The following extract from the briefing note illustrates that DCS Williams and DCS Surtees had reminded themselves accurately that there were many potential victims despite the continued adherence to the narrow interpretation of s of RIPA: It was clear from the spreadsheet and the lines of data supplied by the telephone companies that many potential victims existed and had been subject to their voicemails being called, but that is not sufficient to prove the criminal offence of interception

CLAIM sentence:  The burden is on the prosecution to show they actively led to the defendant gaining access to voice messages prior to the intended recipient gaining access

CLAIM sentence:  The data alone does not even show whether or not messages existed only that the voicemail had been accessed

CLAIM sentence:  It continued: At the time the strategy recognized that there was still extensive research to be done with the phone companies to identify what the full extent of victims might be and therefore as outlined under the section above How were victim identified this could be a vastly bigger group of people and in reality we would probably never know the true scale

CLAIM sentence:  Unfortunately, however, neither of these factors caused DCS Williams to correct his original briefing to Mr Yates concerning the number of victims of voicemail interception which was to the effect that police enquiries showed that the tactic of voicemail interception had only been used against a far smaller number of individuals

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul Stephenson explained that during intermittent discussions with Mr Yates, as the Guardian maintained its coverage, Mr Yates continued to reassure him that there was nothing new in the allegations that would warrant the reopening of the investigation and the investment of significant additional resources

CLAIM sentence:  To put his involvement in its proper context, Sir Paul said that the matter was not a priority for him as Commissioner

CLAIM sentence:  He occasionally had discussions with Mr Yates about it, but he would not have delved further into it because it was getting the right level of senior attention

CLAIM sentence: uk/wp-content/uploads///Witness-Statement-of-Sir-Paul- Stephenson

CLAIM sentence:  The first was attended by DCS Williams, Mr Clements and Mr Hussain from the CPS, and D/Supt Dean Haydon

CLAIM sentence:  According to Mr Clements, Mr Yates told them at that meeting that he was happy to help with piecing together the evolution of the prosecution strategy regarding potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clements and Mr Hussain told Mr Yates that a review was underway and that they would reveal their findings on Wednesday in a press release

CLAIM sentence:  A separate investigation name, Operation Quatraine, was allocated in order to provide a reference point for work done on the recent issues and the costs incurred

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates decided that the Gold Group would provide strategic oversight and that all decisions and records would be recorded in the minutes and that no separate decision log would be maintained

CLAIM sentence:  He presented the Committee with copies of a number of documents including the for Neville email and the contract with Mr Mulcaire which related to the payment of a bonus for the Gordon Taylor story

CLAIM sentence:   Detective Superintendent Haydon was the staff officer to Mr Yates and attended the Gold Group meetings which responded to the Guardian article

CLAIM sentence:  He was subsequently appointed as the SIO of Operation Varec: para 

CLAIM sentence:  This record of the answers given by the police understandably influenced the conclusion reached by Mr Starmer of how the original prosecution had been handled and the extent to which there was any need for a re-evaluation in 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates also claimed to place heavy reliance on this note from counsel but in contrast to Mr Starmer, it was not reasonable for Mr Yates to infer from it that counsel had checked all the material gathered during the investigation for further evidence of criminality

CLAIM sentence:  First, the conference was prior to the review of unused material and was based purely on what counsel were told by the police; secondly, Mr Yates knew (or certainly ought to have known) that the review carried out by counsel (Mr Mably specifically) had been confined to a review of the unused material which had the particular limited purpose of fulfilling the disclosure obligations explained above

CLAIM sentence:  When challenged about the legitimacy of relying on this review of unused material, given its purpose and that Mr Mably had not been asked to decide how the investigation should proceed, Mr Yates accepted the limited nature of the exercise but said that: This was quite an important limb, I would say, in terms of saying, well, okay, he was looking at it from the CPI perspective from the indictment, but if counsel is telling me that they never saw any such evidence, then of course Im going to place some reliance on that

CLAIM sentence:  But it was only one limb of a series of aspects which enabled me to come to that view, if you like

CLAIM sentence:  Whilst it would be fair to find that Mr Yates might have expected counsel reviewing the unused material to notice a document that stood out as a smoking gun, he could not rely on it to conclude that there was no evidence of further criminality

CLAIM sentence:   He asked to be informed of the extent of previous police enquiries into illegal surveillance by journalists, in particular, whether journalists other than Clive Goodman were investigated and why Mr Yates was convinced that no further investigation was needed

CLAIM sentence:  He also asked whether there was any evidence to indicate the existence of arrangements between Mr Mulcaire and other journalists, either at the NoTW or elsewhere, which could have included intercepts and other potentially illegal surveillance

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hussain also prepared a submission for  pp-, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence:  The precise content of any conversation between Mr Hussain and DCS Surtees cannot be ascertained from this note, but I would expect DCS Surtees not to have given the impression that there were no evidential leads relating to named individuals even though there were no confirmed suspects as such

CLAIM sentence:  It stated that the police had provided the CPS with all relevant information and that the approach to charging Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire had been appropriate

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams argues that this report demonstrates he communicated to Mr Yates that there were evidential leads and that the strategic decision had been made not to follow them for resourcing reasons

CLAIM sentence:  In the context of the briefings, I do not consider that it would have conveyed any such message to Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  So for example to explore in terms of data whether or not Gordon Taylor had been the victim of intercept in June  or before as indicated by one seized document was not possible then let alone now

CLAIM sentence:  Later that evening, on  July , the press office of the DPP received an enquiry from Nick Davies as to whether the DPP had called for the NoTW contract and the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  Mr Yates chaired a further Gold Group meeting during which a question was raised about the possible involvement of Neville Thurlbeck (following a question to Mr Yates from Chris Huhne MP), in light of the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  According to the minutes of the meeting, DCS Williams stated that this formed part of his wider prosecution strategy relating to both suspects and victims, which was still robust to that day

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcdemonstrated that DCS Williams emphasised the lack of co-operation from NoTW during the investigation, including no comment interviews, resistance during the searches and refusal to cooperate with telephone data requests

CLAIM sentence:  After the meeting, but also on  July , a briefing note was prepared for Mr Yates, presumably by DCS Williams, which explained the reasons for not having followed up the possible implications of the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  He stressed that the mere sight of transcripts of conversations is not itself sufficient evidence to charge with an offence of conspiracy to intercept communications

CLAIM sentence:  He explained that: It is important to differentiate the investigative strategy and risk reduction strategy taken at the time, to the very different focus today of whether in fact lots of journalists at the NOTW or elsewhere were involved in a criminal conspiracy

CLAIM sentence:  Further enquiries were undertaken by investigators to prove the involvement of other journalists by requesting telephone information and floor plans from News International at the time

CLAIM sentence:  A copy of the email was faxed by the MPS to the CPS later that day, and drawn for the first time to the attention of Mr Starmer

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clements told Mr Starmer that he had spoken to D/Supt Haydon and that: the Met do not consider that the email in question has the significance that the Guardian attribute to it

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer was immediately concerned about the email, because [w]hatever view others took about this email, I was concerned about it

CLAIM sentence:  Taken at face value, it seemed to me to suggest that both the author and recipient were possible suspects

CLAIM sentence:  In answer to my question, Mr Starmer indicated that his assessment of the email was that it was more in the nature of an evidential flag or pointer than a smoking gun, although, even on that basis, he recognised that it did not correspond with the reasonably firm assurance he had been given that there had not been thought to be other suspects

CLAIM sentence:  At pm on  July  a meeting took place between Mr Starmer and David Perry QC

CLAIM sentence:  However, Mr Starmer was still concerned about the email and decided to write to Mr Yates inviting him to consider whether further investigation was now required

CLAIM sentence:  A draft press statement had been prepared to that effect, but, following discussions with Mr Yates later that evening Mr Starmer was persuaded not to issue the statement but to meet Mr Yates the following Monday morning ( July ) to discuss the email in greater detail

CLAIM sentence:  During the course of the Friday evening discussions which followed the meeting with Mr Perry, Mr Starmer sensed a degree of push-back from Mr Yates against his suggestion that there should be a reinvestigation or further investigation of the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  Following those discussions, Mr Starmer issued a press statement which merely said: the DPP is now considering whether any further action is necessary

CLAIM sentence:  On Monday  July, the meeting with Mr Yates and others (including DCS Williams) took place as arranged; the notes made on behalf of the MPS have been made available to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer explained to the police that Mr Perry had told him that he could not remember discussing the for Neville email at the time of the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  The following appeared in the notes: KS

CLAIM sentence:  Told not

CLAIM sentence:  Saw no evidence to support 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer confirmed that this assertion was never contradicted by anyone present at the meeting

CLAIM sentence:  According to Mr Starmer, the key contribution made by Mr Yates to the meeting was that this was not new material; it had been seen by counsel and that the police investigation focused on set parameters, which were an operational matter for the police; furthermore, in any event, the email will go nowhere

CLAIM sentence:  Unsurprisingly, Mr Starmer was not entirely comfortable with this response, given that Mr Perry did not have a recollection of seeing the email, and to the extent that it might have been seen by junior counsel this was in a specific and limited context; that the set parameters rather begged the question; and that his assessment of the evidential strength of the email was not the same as the assessment made by Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  The matter was left on the footing that Mr Starmer would seek written advice from Mr Perry on the status of the email, and that DCS Williams would do a background note to avail him

CLAIM sentence:  He also made a number of observations in the note about the for Neville email, all of which tended to suggest that neither in  nor in  could it amount to evidence that the criminality at the NoTW went beyond Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  It is worthy of additional note that this specific analysis of the email was also to form the basis of the evidence Mr Yates gave to the CMS Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer was anxious to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and so he asked Mr Perry to provide an overnight advice, that is to say before the following morning

CLAIM sentence:  In effect, the DPP wanted Mr Perry to answer the following four very specific questions: (a) based on his knowledge of the case in  and in particular the technical and practical  pp-, lines -, Keir Starmer, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcissues associated with proving offences of interception, what advice would he have given to the CPS/police at the time in respect of the for Neville email, had it been brought specifically to his attention? (b) based on his knowledge at that time (July ), would his advice be any different? (c) based on his knowledge in  whether he was of the view that the police had sufficient to arrest and/or interview Ross and/or Neville

CLAIM sentence:  (d) based on his knowledge at that time (July ) whether he was of the view that the police had sufficient to arrest and/or interview Ross and/or Neville

CLAIM sentence:  At the time of the urgent request for advice, Mr Perry did not have access to his original papers and was also working under the pressure of a court appearance

CLAIM sentence:  Rather than seek further time from Mr Starmer, Mr Perry decided to rely on what he could recall of the prosecution and on the briefing note provided by DCS Williams

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry indicated that he only had a dim recollection of the decisions taken in relation to the investigation and prosecution strategy, but that he had found the note prepared by DCS Williams to be extremely helpful and to accord with such recollection as he did have

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry expounded the narrow view of the law in lapidary and unqualified terms: to prove the criminal offence of unlawful interception contrary to section () of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , it is necessary to prove that the message was intercepted before it was accessed by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry also appeared to suggest that he gave the same advice to the police and the CPS in 

CLAIM sentence:  He stated in his advice dated  July  that the for Neville email did not cause him to acquire a different view of the merits of pursuing other possible defendants

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry has accepted that his statement about the law was too emphatic and that he had been over-reliant on the briefing note

CLAIM sentence:  With the benefit of hindsight, Mr Starmer has since said that it would have been better if, before Mr Perry committed himself, he had been given more time along with the opportunity to check his papers

CLAIM sentence:  That is undoubtedly right but, despite his understandable anxiety to meet the very tight deadline set by the DPP, Mr Perry should not have given unequivocal and unqualified advice, which in any event did not reflect the considered advice he gave in , without, first, re-acquainting himself sufficiently with the law and relevant factual  Not published  In an email dated  October  Mr Mably also adopted the narrow interpretation (not published)

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry believed that this may have been based on the wrong turn which he took in the Advice he drafted in July, which may itself have affected the recollection of Mr Mably: pp-, [lines -], David Perry QC, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  uk/wp-content/uploads///Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing--April-

CLAIM sentence:  Although it might have caused his client some frustration, I have no doubt that Mr Perry should have told Mr Starmer that he needed more time before he could give accurate advice; alternatively, he could have expressed a view only on a provisional basis following it up shortly thereafter, when the papers were to hand and the necessary time available

CLAIM sentence:  Entirely accurately, Mr Perry summarised the position by saying that: the moral of the story is: dont do advices overnight if you dont have the papers

CLAIM sentence:  Basing himself heavily on the advice given by Mr Perry, Mr Starmer confirmed that it would not be appropriate for him to reopen the cases against Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, nor to revisit the decisions taken in the course of investigating and prosecuting them

CLAIM sentence:  It included the following paragraph which, in the circumstances, did not fully reflect the complete picture of what had happened in : Suspects In  Police, CPS and Senior Counsel considered whether or not there was evidence against anyone else and in the light of recent concern have revisited that decision

CLAIM sentence:  Supported by Senior Counsel the collective belief is that when set against both the investigation and prosecution strategy there was and remains insufficient grounds to arrest and /or interview anyone else

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams then explained how Burton Copeland had responded to the various request for information in the following terms: Throughout it would be fair to say that NOTW took a robust, but legal approach to our requests and provided the material in relation to Goodman and Mulcaire only, e

CLAIM sentence: pdf  DCS Williams and Mr Yates gave evidence to the CMS Committee on  September : paras 

CLAIM sentence: - below  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcpart of the prosecution, but we did not have the legal basis with which to push our investigation further

CLAIM sentence:  He set out in that letter that the advice given by Mr Perry had been that the narrow interpretation of s RIPA was correct and that there was nothing to be gained from seeking to contend for a wider interpretation

CLAIM sentence:  On the same day Mr Yates also wrote to the Chairman of the CMS Committee

CLAIM sentence:  Before leaving this section, it is important to deal with the allegations that have been made about the integrity of Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  I recognise that I have strongly criticised his decisions not just with the benefit of hindsight (which is no criticism at all) but having regard to what he knew or could have discovered

CLAIM sentence:  As to the question of ulterior motive, however, it is important to analyse the evidence

CLAIM sentence:  On this question, Mr Yates said: I absolutely know what I did on July th, I know what I was provided with, I know the judgment I made

CLAIM sentence:  Those who worked closely with Mr Yates were and are convinced of his integrity

CLAIM sentence:  As for more senior officers, Lord Blair offered the following assessment: Do I believe that John Yates took that decision in order to placate News International? No, I dont

CLAIM sentence:  But his difficulty, without making it more difficult for him, is the number of contacts, and that, I think, is a problem

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Paul Stephenson was convinced that Mr Yates acted in good faith

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcattempt to back off because it was News International? No, I do not, sir

CLAIM sentence:  He made clear that he did not believe that fear of taking on a powerful enterprise comes into it

CLAIM sentence:  In reality, there is no evidence from which it would be right to infer that Mr Yates was swayed in his decision making by his friendship with Mr Wallis or his relationships with NI more generally

CLAIM sentence:  I agree with Mr Garnham QC that I do not have the evidence to make such a finding

CLAIM sentence:  I do not consider there is any basis for concluding that Mr Yates would permit or did permit his own personal knowledge of individuals to influence his assessment of whether they may be involved in obtaining information for stories by criminal means

CLAIM sentence:  Whatever conclusions I reach about the way in which Mr Yates went about discharging his responsibilities in -, I do not challenge his integrity

CLAIM sentence:  The second attempt to ensure that all potential victims had been informed 

CLAIM sentence:  Having undertaken on  July  to ensure that all suspected victims had been informed, on  July , Mr Yates issued a press statement asserting that: the process of contacting people is currently underway and we expect this to take some time to complete

CLAIM sentence:  In the briefing note dated  July , DCS Williams and DCS Surtees told Mr Yates that although it was not known in detail what actions each mobile phone company took, the steps they did take included contacting customers who they thought might have been a victim

CLAIM sentence:  They gave Mr Yates this assurance despite the fact that neither had ensured either that the phone companies understood that this was their responsibility or that the phone companies had, in fact, informed their customers

CLAIM sentence:  It is plain that Mr Yates was significantly misinformed

CLAIM sentence:  No doubt reassured by this briefing, at the first Gold Group meeting on  July , Mr Yates gave DCS Williams and DCS Surtees the task of reviewing the remainder of the list to establish if there were any other potential victims that should be informed

CLAIM sentence:  It is fair to note that Mr Yates was, indeed, seeking to honour his public undertaking to ensure that all potential victims had been informed

CLAIM sentence:  Weekend focus was then diverted to preparing briefing note and chronology of events

CLAIM sentence:  PW stated after reviewing list there were approx

CLAIM sentence:  Response should [be] received in next  hours and therefore decision pended until we see phone companies response in event there could be duplication of work

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence indicates that this correspondence with the phone companies was the first attempt by the police to check that the phone companies had been notifying potential victims in line with the victim notification strategy

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  DI Maberly received a response from O to this correspondence from the police asking them about what steps they took following the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  They were told we were making changes to the voicemail systems to stop this happening, and advised that O were working with the police to assist in providing evidence to identify and prosecute those responsible

CLAIM sentence:  Some customers requested their details be passed on to the police, and this was done

CLAIM sentence:  Surprisingly, despite the imperative to identify individuals who might not have been informed and the clear instructions from Mr Yates, it does not appear that the police made any attempt to follow this up with Vodafone or Orange and query whether they had notified any potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  Neither have I seen evidence that Mr Yates  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  On  July , as part of Operation Quatraine, Mr Yates directed that all the material seized from Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire be scanned onto ALTIA

CLAIM sentence:  An email drafted on behalf of Mr Yates indicated that the exercise was to be a priority

CLAIM sentence:  The email read: It is of critical importance to the MPS and the command that this is progressed as a priority and this requires attention today please to coordinate

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates explained that around ten detectives spent over four months undertaking this task at a cost of over ,

CLAIM sentence:  It is noteworthy that those working on the exercise appear to have been directed that if, when examining the exhibits, they identified potential further leads for investigation, they should be referred to the SIO for consideration

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates said: I mean in fairness to me on  July or whatever it was I was so concerned about our inability to analyse the material in any shape or form that I asked for it to be put on the HOLMES system

CLAIM sentence:  Orange replied within a few minutes and said: Unfortunately we have responded but would be happy to issue a clarification if necessary

CLAIM sentence:  DI Maberly also explained that the police were intending to give the relevant numbers to the phone companies in order to ascertain to which network they belonged at the time and might then ask the phone companies to make contact with those customers

CLAIM sentence:  O replied that day in the following terms: We identified a number of customers we believed may have had their voicemails intercepted and I advised Philip Williams at the time that we intended to proactively contact them and let them know

CLAIM sentence:  Orange also replied the same day stating that they told Nick Davies that they had given the police the phone numbers of  Orange customers whose voicemails boxes had been accessed by the suspect numbers provided by the police

CLAIM sentence:  She told DI Maberly that she did not confirm any numbers to Nick Davies

CLAIM sentence:  On  February , the MPS received a request from Nick Davies under Freedom of Information Act ; this included requests for the total number of full names, partial names and initials including possible misspellings and duplications, which were listed on the database and the total number of mobile phone numbers (full and partial)

CLAIM sentence:  On  February , Mr Yates wrote again to the Chairman of the CMS Committee and contended that during his evidence in September  he had answered the questions as fully as possible

CLAIM sentence:  What we can say is that where information exists to suggest some form of interception of an individuals phone was or may have been attempted by Goodman and Mulcaire, the MPS has been diligent and taken all proper steps to ensure those individuals have been informed

CLAIM sentence:  The latter paragraph indicates that the police had still failed to ascertain or recognise the extent of the failure of the victim notification strategy despite having identified, initially at least, the importance of notifying all those whose privacy had potentially been invaded

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams made reference to the fact that DI Maberly had examined the  individuals whose names, mobile phone numbers and pin codes appeared in the papers seized from Mr Mulcaire and identified  people who: will not have been contacted by us and potentially the service providers and from the billing data provided as part of the original investigation, there are calls that are greater than  seconds (i

CLAIM sentence:  enough to enter the voicemail and listen to any message left as per the criteria used for the trial) Albeit not proved at an evidential level that interception has taken place, if the data is correct then there is a case for saying that for these individuals the possession of their name/mobile/pin has probably gone beyond more than merely preparatory and therefore there is suspicion that some form of phone tapping may have taken place

CLAIM sentence:  The following are options for informing them

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcIf we did this I would suggest we are quite firm on saying that we are not investigating the case, we are simply carrying out John Yates promise to inform people and if they have any concerns to contact their service provider

CLAIM sentence:  If we cannot contact them, because the phone is now out of use or has moved on to someone else then that would be the end of the process on the basis that we have been diligent, reasonable and sensible, and taken all proper steps

CLAIM sentence:  It probably would [be] possible to undertake further enquiries beyond ringing the phone numbers to try to contact those individuals

CLAIM sentence:  Option  We approach the service providers directly and/or through Jack Wraith (who originally coordinated much of the contact/press lines with the service providers) and supply them with details of these last few people and ask them to clarify whether or not they have any concerns and make contact with the customer

CLAIM sentence:  Issues to consider: This would share the responsibility for determining who is a victim with the service providers as it was the weaknesses in their system that has caused all this work for us and in theory if they had any concerns back in  they should have contacted their customers

CLAIM sentence:  This would take an unknown time and it is important to send out the Nick Davies FOIA this week

CLAIM sentence:  Option  We could complete Option  immediately and then consider pursuing the remainder through option 

CLAIM sentence:  If the combination of both did not make contact then that would be deemed reasonable and diligent

CLAIM sentence:  The paper did not reach a conclusion as to which option should be selected

CLAIM sentence:  It is not clear whether any further victims were informed following this paper being written, but it does indicate a clear lack of enthusiasm for informing any further potential victims, despite the undertaking given by Mr Yates in July the previous year

CLAIM sentence:  It appears to have been considered to be a time consuming and expensive exercise for no real gain

CLAIM sentence:  It was recorded that a strategy for new victims was being devised and that the proposed course was to write to each prospective victim and ask them to approach their service provider to see if they held any information to support their suspicion

CLAIM sentence:  In October , Nick Davies reported that he had contacted the mobile phone service providers and ascertained that not all the victims had been contacted

CLAIM sentence:  It is remarkable that this had still not been done, particularly given the earlier correspondence from the phone companies which indicated that O had notified customers but only at their own instigation and that Orange and Vodafone had not notified any customers

CLAIM sentence:  The minutes of a Gold Group meeting held on  October  recorded that DCS Williams had completed the previous action that he provide details to Mr Yates of notifications to potential victims and that there was an on-going action involving liaison by DCS Williams with the telephone companies to establish which victims they had informed and cross-compare them with the list compiled by the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, on  November , Vodafone dealt with the enquiry in the following terms: I am surprised that you say that you thought at the time of the investigation that all of the people potentially identified as being victims had been contacted by Service Providers, including Vodafone

CLAIM sentence:  As regards this failure of this second attempt to ensure that all potential victims had been informed, Mr Yates said that the exercise had been conducted with the very best intentions but that it was fairly torturous

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates accepted responsibility for its failure and explained it as follows: the day-to-day management of the exercise to place all documentation on the Holmes computer was not at the level I expected or that was required

CLAIM sentence:  I find that the MPS (and, in particular, Mr Yates, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees) failed to take effective steps, at any time before November , to ensure that those potential victims who had not been informed were informed as soon as practicable

CLAIM sentence:  It is worthwhile briefly to revisit the failure to identify that Lord Prescott was a potential victim

CLAIM sentence:  By letter dated  December , he was eventually informed by the Directorate of Legal Services at the MPS that he was a person of interest to Mr Mulcaire in that there was a piece of paper containing the words John Prescott and Hull, and two self-billing tax invoices dated  and  May , addressed to News International Supply Company Limited and containing the words Story Other Prescott Assist TXT and Story Other Prescott Assist TXT: Urgent

CLAIM sentence:  He was not, however, alerted to the more concerning references to his adviser, her phone numbers and her pass codes, which had been discovered in the short space of time after Mr Mulcaires arrest but before his interview

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates attributed the failure to indexing problems on the HOLMES database: I think what happened, and I say and Ive absolutely stated this in my statement and accepted it, that there was an indexing issue around the name John Prescott being linked to his I think it was his adviser, whose name I would never have known or could never I dont think anyone could have made the link, to be honest 

CLAIM sentence:  This is not, however, the complete answer

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence, Mr Yates stressed with some force that he checked on a number of occasions whether there was evidence that Lord Prescott had been a victim and that he always received the same answer, upon which he understandably relied

CLAIM sentence:  He emphasised: I cannot tell you the amount of times I checked and sought further and better particulars about the possibility that Mr Prescotts phone had been interfered with

CLAIM sentence:  It would be literally scores over the following months 

CLAIM sentence:  He continued: Because I was so concerned, the idea of misleading the Deputy Prime Minister is not something Id relish and I was absolutely desperate to get to the bottom if there was something there

CLAIM sentence:  DCS Williams has said that he briefed Mr Yates to the best of his ability; that he does not believe that all the material came to light until it had been scanned onto the HOLMES system some months later; and that he ensured that he showed Mr Yates all the material as it became available, including references to Tracey Temple

CLAIM sentence:  For the reasons explained above, I make no finding as to precisely what was brought to the attention of Mr Yates but, to say the very least, it is disappointing that what was inferred by the interviewing detectives within hours of the material being seized was not more clearly communicated to Mr Yates as he was being pressed by the Deputy Prime Minister

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  the PCC wrote to Mr Myler asking a number of questions, including the following: Does it remain your position that the illegal behaviour of Clive Goodman was a rogue exception and that no other journalists or executives of the newspaper were aware of the practice of phone message tapping by anyone employed by the paper? 

CLAIM sentence:  In his letter of response dated  August  Mr Myler stated that the allegations in the Guardian were not just unsubstantiated and irresponsible, they were wholly false

CLAIM sentence:  In response to the particular question quoted in the paragraph above he said: Our internal enquiries have found no evidence of involvement by News of the World staff other than Clive Goodman in phone message interception beyond the e-mail transcript which emerged in April  during the Gordon Taylor litigation and which has since been revealed in the original Guardian report

CLAIM sentence:  That email was dated June   and consisted of a transcript of voicemails from the phone of Gordon Taylor and another person which had apparently been recorded by Glenn Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  The email and transcript were created by a junior reporter (who has since left the newspaper)

CLAIM sentence:  When questioned after the email was supplied to us by Gordon Taylors lawyers in April , the junior reporter accepted that he had created the relevant email document but had no recollection of it beyond that

CLAIM sentence:  Since by the end of June  he had been a reporter for only a week or so (having been promoted off the floor where he had been a messenger) and since the first months of his reporting career consisted largely of transcribing tapes for other people, his lack of recollection when questioned three years later is perhaps understandable

CLAIM sentence:  Email searches of relevant people failed to show any trace of the email being sent to or received by any other News of the World staff member

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler was asked during his evidence whether his internal enquiries had in fact demonstrated that the allegation made by the Guardian that there had been hacking into  para 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler responded as follows: I didnt have any direct information that our internal enquiries had gone to that point, and as I said earlier, one of the things that weighed heavily with me when I came in was the fact that the police hadnt interviewed anybody else other than Goodman in their enquiries

CLAIM sentence:  To the suggestion that, when making this assertion to the PCC, he had not relied on any information that he had obtained through internal enquiries Mr Myler said: Other than the appeal that Mr Goodman I had to conduct with the head of human resources and the allegations that he made, and then talking to those individuals who he made allegations against

CLAIM sentence:  It was put to Mr Myler that his evidence had been that after June  he no longer believed the single rogue reporter defence (on the basis that it was untenable after the for Neville email was discovered) but that in this letter to the PCC he was effectively stating that there was no evidence which went beyond Mr Goodman and therefore that the single rogue reporter defence was true

CLAIM sentence:  He said: Well, the rogue reporter defence failed to hold once the for Neville email was discovered

CLAIM sentence:  It is not and cannot be acceptable for Mr Myler to rely on the evidence he gave to the Select Committee to support the proposition that the PCC would not have been misled by an entirely contradictory assertion that was contained in his response to them

CLAIM sentence:  On any showing, what he said to the PCC was neither full nor frank

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, Mr Myler told the PCC that the process of internal investigation had been rigorous and that News Group had instructed Burton Copeland, an independent firm of solicitors, to deal with further police inquiries after the arrests of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  This is the most that the Inquiry has been told about the work carried out by Burton Copeland given that NI has not waived legal professional privilege

CLAIM sentence:  above  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcfinancial documentation); what sources of information they were able to access; the precise terms of their instruction; what investigations they made; or what, if any, caveats surrounded their conclusions

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, the reliance by Mr Myler on their work is hardly persuasive

CLAIM sentence:  The PCC has seen no new evidence to suggest that the practice of phone message tapping was undertaken by others beyond Goodman and Mulcaire, or evidence that News of the World executives knew about Goodman and Mulcaires activities

CLAIM sentence:  It follows that there is nothing to suggest that the PCC was materially misled during its  inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee also invited Glenn Mulcaire, Clive Goodman, Neville Thurlbeck and Rebecca Brooks to give evidence but all declined (save for Mr Thurlbeck who was prepared to give evidence but only in private)

CLAIM sentence:  In giving evidence to the Committee, NI witnesses continued to assert that Mr Goodman had acted alone

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hinton told the Committee: There was never any evidence delivered to me that suggested that the conduct of Clive Goodman spread beyond him

CLAIM sentence:  In response to questions suggesting that termination payments to Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman could be interpreted as an attempt to prevent them speaking out about practices at the newspaper, Mr Hinton said he had authorised the payments on the advice of specialist employment lawyers

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Coulson told the Committee that during his time as editor he never condoned the use of phone hacking and that he did not have any recollection of incidences where phone hacking took place

CLAIM sentence:  When asked whether he commissioned an enquiry when he found out about the arrests, Mr Coulson said: Yes

CLAIM sentence:  Obviously we wanted to know internally very quickly what the hell had gone on

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Coulson did concede that Burton Copeland were tasked with the primary purpose, I have to say, of trying to find out what happened in relation to Clive

CLAIM sentence:  On the remit of the internal investigations Mr Myler said: My recollection was that a very thorough investigation took place where there was a review of everything from how cash payments were processed When asked about the width of the internal enquiry Mr Crone gave the following account: By the time I got back, which must have been August , Burton Copeland were in the office virtually every day or in contact with the office every day

CLAIM sentence:  My understanding of their remit was that they were brought in to go over everything and find out what had gone on, to liaise with the police What I think was being enquired into was what had gone on leading to the arrests; what, in the relationship with Mulcaire, did we have to worry about

CLAIM sentence:  Burton Copeland came in; they were given absolutely free- range to ask whatever they wanted to ask

CLAIM sentence:  I do no more than record what Mr Crone said

CLAIM sentence:  It was struck by the collective amnesia afflicting witnesses from the News of the World

CLAIM sentence: pdf  p, para , ibid  p, para , ibid  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xca culture undoubtedly did exist it the newsroom of the News of the World and other newspapers at the time which at best turned a blind eye to illegal activities such as phone-hacking and blagging and at worst actively condoned it 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates told the Committee that the approach during the investigation had been that an offence under s RIPA  was committed only where the messages intercepted had not previously been listened to by the intended recipient

CLAIM sentence:  He said: Our job, as ever, is to follow the evidence and to make considered decisions based upon our experience which ensures limited resources are used both wisely and effectively and, supported by senior counsel, including the DPP, the collective belief is that there were then and there remain now insufficient grounds or evidence to arrest or interview anyone else and, as I have said already, no additional evidence has come to light since

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates described his July  review in the following terms: I considered the approach adopted by the prosecution team in their papers, what were they actually focused on, and it was those eight cases

CLAIM sentence:  We have been told that choice was endorsed by the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  Nevertheless it is our view that the decision was a wrong one

CLAIM sentence:  The Guardians fresh revelations in July , however, provided good reason for the PCC to be more assertive in its enquiries, rather than accepting submissions from the News of the World once again at face value

CLAIM sentence:  In fact, an examination based on police records, court documents and interviews with investigators and reporters show that Britains revered police agency failed to pursue leads suggesting that one of the countrys most powerful newspapers was routinely listening in on its citizens

CLAIM sentence:  Scotland Yard even had a recording of Mulcaire walking one journalist who may have worked at yet another tabloid step by step through the hacking of a soccer officials voice mail, according to a copy of the tape

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcIt reported that during interviews with more than a dozen reporters and editors at the NoTW claims were made that voicemail interception was an industry-wide thing, that Every hack on every newspaper knew this was done and that it was pervasive at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  The MPS detectives had faced pressure from within their own organisation and were reminded of the long-term relationship with News International

CLAIM sentence:  (e) By sitting on the evidence for so long, the MPS had made it impossible to get (f) information from phone companies, which do not keep records indefinitely

CLAIM sentence:  On  September  one of the reporters quoted in the New York Times article, Sean Hoare, was interviewed on BBC Radio 

CLAIM sentence:  He repeated the expression the dark arts and said that phone hacking was endemic in the industry

CLAIM sentence:  He made clear allegations which, in order to avoid prejudice to the ongoing investigation, are not repeated here

CLAIM sentence:  Given the resurgence of the allegations and the additional detail provided by the New York Times and Mr Hoare, Mr Yates should have reflected carefully on the exercise that he conducted in  and reviewed, in more depth, what evidence was gathered during Operation Caryatid and what it might show

CLAIM sentence:  He did not, as he should have done, revert to DCS Williams and DCS Surtees and ask them for full details of what the crucial clues or leads might be that indicated that Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were not acting alone or ask them to explain fully what indications there might be that the three named journalists had been involved in the conspiracy

CLAIM sentence:  It is quite clear that having made the dogmatic and over-hasty decision on  July , he then failed to assess anything that might conceivably challenge the correctness of his initial decision with anything approaching an open mind

CLAIM sentence:  It remained the case that Mr Yates was not prepared to entertain the possibility that there was anything in the vast quantity of documentation held by the police, that had not been analysed, that could itself generate lines of enquiry; he was interested only in the question of whether the New York Times could itself produce evidence

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates also took the opportunity to re-state the lack of evidence that Lord Prescott had been a victim: Separately, we are aware of the current claims in the media from, amongst others, Lord Prescott about his view that his phone was hacked

CLAIM sentence:  The terms of reference for the Gold Group were stated to be: To provide ACPO oversight of the various MPS strands relating to phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  The summary of the minutes of the meeting on  September  stated that: JY explained that the purpose of the actions required was to seek clarity as to whether there was any new evidence amongst the recent media reporting before making any further decision

CLAIM sentence:  This is not, at this stage, a further investigation

CLAIM sentence:  There was also an action point for Mr Yates to consult the DPP or an appropriate deputy

CLAIM sentence:  Late in the evening of  September , Mr Yates made contact with the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  According to the Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, to whom he spoke, Mr Yates said that he wanted to update Mr Starmer and let him know that he (Mr Yates) did not intend to reopen the investigation but merely to clarify what had been said in the New York Times article by inviting the journalists to provide their material and by interviewing Sean Hoare; thereafter, they might then seek the advice of the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  The exercise, although stated not to be an investigation, was subsequently given the name Operation Varec and the following terms of reference:  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Not published  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcTo assess whether allegations being made in the media since st September  provided any new evidence of criminal offences, namely unlawful interception of communications, at News of the World, in /

CLAIM sentence:  At around this time, D/Supt Haydon asked a HOLMES supervisor to carry out a search on the HOLMES database for evidence that Lord Prescott had been targeted by Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  In an email dated  September , he was informed by that supervisor that the name John Prescott appeared on p of seven notepads seized from Mr Mulcaire and that word PREZA appeared once in handwritten notes

CLAIM sentence:  It appears that Lord Prescott was not given this information, but it is right to repeat that, in December , he had been informed that his name and other details appeared in the Mulcaire documents

CLAIM sentence:  Reverting to the position of the CPS, following the publication of the New York Times article, Mr Starmer quickly took stock of what action he needed to take

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer explained that: Whilst respecting the views of David Perry QC and Louis Mably, I had in fact had concerns for some time about the emphatic view of the construction of sections  and  of RIPA that had been articulated by Mr Perry QC in  and adopted by me in my letters and evidence to the CMS committee

CLAIM sentence:  I therefore decided that it would be sensible to look again at the matter, particularly since it appeared that the CPS might be required to give the MPS advice in relation to the allegations in the New York Times

CLAIM sentence:  In the result, Mr Starmer decided to commission two written advices: the first was to be from original counsel, who would be asked to consider the original papers and give a definitive view of the approach taken to s of RIPA in  to ; the second advice was sought from fresh counsel, Mr Mark Heywood QC, who had had no previous connection to the case

CLAIM sentence:  Having this time had the opportunity to consider the papers, Mr Perry concluded that for purposes of the  prosecution it had not in fact been necessary to resolve the question of whether or not s of RIPA required proof that the interception had taken place before the intended recipient had accessed the message (given that Mr Mulcaire had pleaded guilty to the indictment)

CLAIM sentence:  Having refreshed his memory from the papers, Mr Perry stated that the oral advice he gave in  had been that the proper construction of RIPA was a difficult issue, with tenable arguments either way; and that a narrow approach to the construction of RIPA had not limited the scope of the police investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Upon receipt of this advice Mr Starmer was naturally concerned that this did not fully correspond with what he had been told in , which itself had been the basis of his letters  John Yates, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Perry was therefore instructed to advise to whether the for Neville email should now be viewed in a different way in the light of his more recent advice

CLAIM sentence:  On  September , Mr Perry provided a note in which he confirmed that the construction of RIPA set out in his advice written  months earlier had been taken from the note drafted by DCS Williams

CLAIM sentence:  In a sustained and sophisticated analysis of the competing legal arguments, Mr Heywood inclined to the view that the broader construction of RIPA was to be preferred, having regard to the purpose underpinning the legislation and additional materials sent to him by First Parliamentary Counsel

CLAIM sentence:  In his subsequent dealings with Parliamentary Select Committees, Mr Starmer no longer adhered to a narrow interpretation of RIPA: in essence, he indicated that the approach he intended to adopt would be to advise the police and CPS prosecutors to proceed on the assumption that a court might adopt a wide interpretation of sections  and  of RIPA

CLAIM sentence:  On  October , The Dispatches programme, Tabloids, Tories and Telephone Hacking, reported allegations that the NoTW had been involved in the unlawful interception of voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Myler replied on  October , stating: I am aware of the allegations made in the Dispatches programme, concerning telephone voicemail accessing in -

CLAIM sentence:  However, I am as sure as I can be that since I became editor of the News of the World in January  neither the newspaper nor its staff have collected or obtained information by means of unlawful interception

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, I am as sure as I can be that neither the newspaper nor its staff are in possession of such material whenever it may have originally been collected

CLAIM sentence:  D/Supt Haydon then drafted a letter which Mr Crone circulated on his behalf, on  October , to  members of staff

CLAIM sentence:  Meanwhile, at the CPS, it appears that Mr Starmer was frustrated that the matter was not going to be investigated

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clements recorded in a note of a meeting on  October  that Mr Starmer said: No one wants to reopen the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer explained in evidence that: I honestly cant remember what I said at that meeting but I obviously said something

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clements does remember it and wrote it down at the time and thought I was frustrated because it appeared to me that others wouldnt reopen the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He stressed in the document that his task had not been to re-open or re-investigate the cases of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, but noted that there were links and crossovers with the prosecution

CLAIM sentence:  He set out details of the four phases of the investigation (or scoping exercise)

CLAIM sentence:  The police interviewed Andy Coulson in the presence of his solicitor, who denied any involvement with or knowledge of phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  During phase two the police approached Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire but both declined to assist the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Neville Thurlbeck was interviewed under caution

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Thurlbeck produced a pre-prepared statement and denied knowledge of ever receiving the for Neville email

CLAIM sentence:  He produced a pre-prepared statement in which he outlined his dealings with Mr Mulcaire but refused to answer any further questions

CLAIM sentence:  Matt Driscoll was interviewed

CLAIM sentence:  He was employed at the NoTW as a sports reporter but was dismissed in  for supposed inaccurate reporting

CLAIM sentence:  Has the current MPS investigation revealed any further evidence relating to unlawful interception of communications, namely mobile telephone voicemails, involving The News of the World? It is my view that there remains a vast amount of press and media coverage, claims and allegations but with no substantive evidence in support

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Clements also stated in the advice document that: I have agreed with Detective Superintendent Haydon that in the future if any revelations come to the attention of the Metropolitan police that he considers could properly be said to constitute new and substantial evidence of offending that we will meet together as a panel and conduct a joint assessment of the material and decide whether further assessment or investigation is likely to provide evidence to support criminal proceedings

CLAIM sentence:  Based on Operation Varec, Mr Yates has claimed that the issues raised by the New York Times article were properly scoped in collaboration with the CPS

CLAIM sentence:  I do not agree

CLAIM sentence:  What Mr Yates scoped was a consideration of the material that had been put in the public domain by the New York Times and the Dispatches programme which itself involved a number of requests and interviews; having regard to the circumstances, it is not surprising that these were unrevealing

CLAIM sentence:  What he did not do was go back to the original allegation both in the Guardian and the New York Times, namely, that there was information in the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire which incriminated others at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  This was the reason for the allegation that was so potentially damaging to the MPS that it was engaged in a cover up

CLAIM sentence:  On  December , the allegations were provided with a fresh impetus when the Guardian published allegations made by Sienna Miller in her civil claim against NGN and Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  The article, entitled Phone hacking approved by top News of the World executive new files reported that Particulars of Claim filed by Ms Miller alleged that the interception of voicemail messages on phones belonging to members of the Royal Household: was part of a scheme commissioned by the [News of the World] and not simply the unauthorised work of its former royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, acting as a rogue reporter as it [had] previously claimed

CLAIM sentence:  The Guardian article alleged that one of the documents disclosed implied that Mr Mulcaire had been instructed to intercept voicemail messages received by Ms Miller and also by her mother, her publicist, one of her closest friends, as well as Jude Law, her former partner, and his personal assistant

CLAIM sentence:  In or about January  the News of the World agreed a scheme with Glenn Mulcaire whereby he would, on their behalf, obtain information on individuals relating to the following: political, royal and showbiz/entertainment; and that he would use electronic intelligence and eavesdropping in order to obtain this information

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer explained, frankly, that these were not easy questions to answer given that there was no one to hand within the CPS who had first-hand knowledge of the investigation and prosecution in 

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, however, Mr Starmer was becoming increasingly concerned by the evidence emerging from the civil claim and he decided that the time had come for a much fuller exercise

CLAIM sentence:  He explained:  What then happened was that as I understood it, some of the information that was emerging from the Sienna Miller civil action I was told had in fact been amongst the unused material

CLAIM sentence:  Now, this was the second time this had occurred

CLAIM sentence:  In that context, a meeting took place on Friday  January  attended by Mr Starmer, Mr Yates and various other officials and police officers

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer opened the meeting by stating that in view of recent events the time may well have come to reconsider everything that is or was available thereby enabling the CPS, if asked, to give comprehensive answers to current and future questions

CLAIM sentence:  The immediate riposte of Mr Yates was to assert that if new evidence were available he would examine it but that he did not believe this to be the position

CLAIM sentence:  In answer to the question whether the mood of the meeting was all sweetness and light, Mr Starmer stated the following in evidence:  I was absolutely clear in my mind at the beginning of that meeting I was going to settle for nothing less than a full review of all this material unless somebody blocked me access to it, and I approached it in that way

CLAIM sentence:  To be fair to Mr Yates, who did not seek to block that approach, and in the end agreed to it, but I have to say but by then I had reached the stage where I really was not in the mood for being dissuaded from my then course of action, I am afraid

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer also said that Mr Yates had a number of concerns about how the review would be handled, but did not resist his proposal that there be a root and branch review

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Starmer highlighted that Mr Yates was keen that the MPS should request the review rather than having it imposed on them

CLAIM sentence:  They therefore agreed that Mr Yates would formally invite the DPP to conduct a review

CLAIM sentence:  After the meeting Mr Starmer decided that his Principal Legal Adviser, Ms Alison Levitt QC, should carry it out

CLAIM sentence:  He stated as follows in his witness statement: In early January , my level of concern as to how matters had been dealt with to date caused me to formally request the DPP to undertake a review of all the material in police possession

CLAIM sentence:  This he agreed to do and he tasked Alison Levitt, QC to undertake this task on his behalf

CLAIM sentence:  It should be noted that Mr Yates was not questioned about this meeting or asked if he agreed that he said that both organisations had been put in a difficult position, and if so, what he meant by it

CLAIM sentence:  That same day Mr Yates wrote to the DPP in the following terms, acknowledging, apparently for the first time, the possibility that there might be evidence in the existing material which would warrant further investigation: We are both aware that there remain outstanding public, legal and political concerns

CLAIM sentence:  This is particularly so in relation to the various and recently reported high profile civil cases As a result, I consider it would be wise to invite you to further re-examine all the material collected in this matter

CLAIM sentence:  This would also enable you to advise me and assure yourself as to whether there is any existing material which could now form evidence in any future criminal prosecution relating to phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Yates claimed that it was this new evidence that brought about his decision to reopen the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  To complete the chronology, on  July , the Guardian reported that the NoTW had hacked the mobile phone belonging to Milly Dowler

CLAIM sentence:  On  July  the final edition of the NoTW was published, with the editorial admitting: Quite simply, we lost our way Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry

CLAIM sentence:  On  July , for reasons not connected with this investigation but in the light of further allegations relating to his conduct, Sir Paul Stephenson resigned and, on  July , Mr Yates also resigned

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee expressed the following view of the exercise conducted by Mr Yates: Although what Mr Yates was tasked to do was not a review in the proper police use of the term, the public was allowed to form the impression that the material seized from Mr Mulcaire in  was being re-examined to identify any other potential victims and perpetrators

CLAIM sentence:  It is clear that the officers consulted about the earlier investigation were not asked the right questions, otherwise we assume it would have been obvious that there was the potential to identify far more possible perpetrators in the material seized from Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence: \t The\tpast\tunravels The civil proceedings before Vos J and the disclosure process 

CLAIM sentence:  By way of example, on  December  Vos J ordered the MPS to disclose the following classes of documents to Skylet Andrew: (a) Telephone records used by Mr Muclaire relating to the accessing of Mr Andrews voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  (b) Documents evidencing communications between Mr Mulcaire and another person concerning the interception activities of Mr Mulcaire in relation to Mr Andrews voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  (c) Documents evidencing communications between Mr Mulcaire and employees of NGN concerning information about Mr Andrew

CLAIM sentence:  (d) Documents concerning payments for information made by NGN to Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  (e) (f) Documents found during the MPS investigation referring to Mr Andrew or his mobile Transcripts of Mr Andrews voicemail messages obtained from Mr Mulcaire

CLAIM sentence:  On  January , Mr Mulcaire provided information to Mr Andrew indicating that he had supplied information from voicemail messages belonging to Mr Andrew to the news desk at the NoTW, identifying the name of the person whom he alleged had asked him to intercept the voicemail messages

CLAIM sentence:  As a further example, on  July , Hugh Grant and Jemima Khan obtained an order, with the consent of the MPS, for the disclosure of documents concerning the voicemail messages allegedly intercepted by Mr Mulcaire and forming the subject of newspaper articles about them in the NoTW and other newspapers

CLAIM sentence:  It is admitted that certain of its employees were aware of, sanctioned and requested the methods used by [Mr Mulcaire] which included the unlawful interception of mobile phone messages and obtaining call and  By way of provisions that enable a party to litigation to obtain disclosure from a person or body that is not a party to that litigation  Skylet Andrew v News Group Newspapers Ltd and another [] EWHC   Admissions made by NGN for the purposes of civil litigation may be relevant in relation to a general consideration of the practices of the press but do not constitute any form of admission on behalf of any individual employee and cannot be assumed to be directed to any individual employee  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xctext data (which methods are known as phone hacking; obtaining information by blagging: and, in one case, unlawfully accessing emails)

CLAIM sentence:  NGN consented to the assessment of aggravated damages on the basis that there were those at NGN who knew about its wrongdoing and sought to conceal it by putting out public statements they knew to be false, deliberately failing to provide the police with all facts of which they were aware, deliberately deceiving the police in respect of the purpose of payments to Mr Mulcaire and destroying evidence of wrongdoing

CLAIM sentence:  Four such individuals were Chris Bryant, MP for the Rhondda, Brendan Montague, Brian Paddick and Lord Prescott

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Bryant was informed that his name and telephone number appeared in the material retrieved during the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Bryant said that the information provided was vague and incomplete

CLAIM sentence:  He said that he was told by the MPS informally in a telephone conversation that he would not be given any further information without a court order

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Paddick was told that there was no information to suggest that he had been subject to unlawful monitoring or interception of his telephone

CLAIM sentence:  His solicitors enquired again and the MPS then reported that, in fact, his name and occupation did appear in the documents obtained during the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  As regards Lord Prescott, as set out above, initially, Mr Yates personally assured him that there was no evidence to suggest that his voicemail messages had been intercepted; he was not told about the references to his adviser and her telephone numbers and pass codes

CLAIM sentence:  So far as Mr Montague was concerned, there was no evidence at the time the proceedings were instituted that his name appeared in the documentary material recovered during the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately, he did not dispute that no evidence had emerged that his name or details featured in any of the materials seized from Mr Mulcaire in 

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Prescott was added to the proceedings in November 

CLAIM sentence:  The claimants challenged the decisions of the MPS as to the scope of Operation Caryatid and the decision not to inform every person whose voicemail messages had or may have been intercepted that this had or may have occurred

CLAIM sentence:  On  February , the Directorate of Legal Services at the MPS wrote to Lord Prescott and informed him that in recent material supplied by News International there was an email (from an email address associated with Mr Mulcaire) dated  April  which appeared to contain the details of the mobile telephone number and PIN number of the adviser to Lord Prescott and that there was reference to  messages

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , Mr Bryant was shown facing pages in a notebook seized from Mr Mulcaire which contained telephone numbers which would have dialled his phone and very probably left voicemails messages, various addresses where he has lived, the names of his partners, his constituency, his home telephone numbers and other personal information

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , Mr Paddick was shown three documents obtained by the police in 

CLAIM sentence:  The information included his police mobile phone number, the mobile phone number of his then partner and his former partner, the addresses and telephone numbers of numerous other associates, his own landline number and landline numbers of others

CLAIM sentence:  There was also a print out from the electronic records held by Mr Mulcaire which described Mr Paddick as a project

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Justice Foskett considered the facts set out above and decided that in relation to the cases of Mr Bryant, Mr Paddick and Lord Prescott, each raised a claim worthy of consideration at a full hearing

CLAIM sentence:  Ultimately the claim for judicial review was compromised, with admissions being made by the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  I have no doubt that neither Peter Clarke nor any of the other officers were or would have been affected by any relationships between some senior officers and NI personnel

CLAIM sentence:  There is no evidence that the relevant officers approached the task from the standpoint of seeking to deal with any alleged wrongdoers other than properly and so as to bring the force of the law to bear

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, I find no evidence of compromise to the independence of the police officers engaged on Operation Caryatid who were prepared to follow evidence as far as it went but were equally mindful of other operational imperatives

CLAIM sentence:  Given how little was known about voicemail interception when the investigation began in December  and the challenges involved in understanding how the interceptions were taking place and then proving the interceptions, it could only have been (and was) a robust, tenacious, well-motivated and skilful team that achieved such extensive evidence that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire were driven to admit their guilt

CLAIM sentence:  There is equally no doubt that the decision made in or around late September  by Peter Clarke not to expand the investigation was wholly justified given the threat from terrorism and the enormous counter terrorism operations then in play (to say nothing of other serious crime the investigation of which would be under-staffed because of the demands of such investigations)

CLAIM sentence:  Unfortunately, at almost every turn, the strategy devised was not fit for purpose; neither did it succeed

CLAIM sentence:  First, the strategy was insufficiently thought out

CLAIM sentence:  Its formulation did not even encompass everyone identified in the blue book

CLAIM sentence:  It was intended that those whose voicemail boxes had been rung by the suspect numbers would be informed

CLAIM sentence:  The strategy therefore overlooked those identified in the blue book whose voicemail boxes may have been infiltrated by a journalist other than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  It also overlooked those whose voicemail boxes had been  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcaccessed by the suspect numbers but at such an early date that the phone companies no longer retained the relevant records

CLAIM sentence:  Second, the police did not make the phone companies aware (sufficiently or, probably at all) of the role that it was intended for them to play; neither did the police obtain their agreement to undertake such a role

CLAIM sentence:  It was simply assumed that, having been asked to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes had been called by the suspect numbers, the phone companies would naturally inform all those that they identified

CLAIM sentence:  Further, despite proceeding on this assumption, no steps at all appear to have been taken to check that the phone companies had carried out the task as anticipated

CLAIM sentence:  Although the investigating officers knew that there was an enormous body of material seized from Glenn Mulcaire which pointed towards large scale collection of information about mobile phones, PINs and other personal details, no sufficient thought was given to what impact that material had on the issue of warning victims or potential victims

CLAIM sentence:  The response of NI to the prosecution and allegations of widespread criminality within the News of the World 

CLAIM sentence:  NI failed to carry out a proper internal investigation into what had emerged from the prosecution or into the allegations made by Mr Goodman when appealing against his dismissal

CLAIM sentence:  Apart from a review of emails sent or received by the individuals named by Mr Goodman, the investigation was limited to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler asking the individuals concerned whether there was any substance to the allegations and accepting at face value their denials

CLAIM sentence:  There was no detailed analysis of precisely what Mr Mulcaire had done to justify the enormous sums that he had been paid and no sign that the NoTW was concerned with anything other than further damage to its reputation or that it regarded the fact that criminal conduct may have flourished as a significant risk either from a corporate governance or operational perspective

CLAIM sentence:  Despite the inadequacy of the internal enquiries that were conducted and despite the belief held by Mr Crone that it was inaccurate to assert the one rogue reporter defence, NI maintained publicly that Mr Goodman acted alone

CLAIM sentence:  Even when Mr Silverleaf QC advised that there was powerful evidence of a culture of illegal information access used to produce stories for publication, there was no internal investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Rupert and James Murdoch claimed that there had been a cover up to which senior management had been victim

CLAIM sentence:  If that was right, then the accountability and governance systems at NI would have to be considered to have broken down in an extremely serious respect

CLAIM sentence:  Whatever the truth, there was serious failure of governance within the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Given the criminal investigation and what are now the impending prosecutions, it is simply not possible to go further at this stage

CLAIM sentence:  Before the PCC and the CMS Committee, NI maintained the stance that there was no evidence that any member of staff at the NoTW had been involved in voicemail interception other than Mr Goodman

CLAIM sentence:  These are: (a) (b) In reality, Mr Yates failed adequately to address any question other than whether there was anything in the newspaper reports that constituted new evidence

CLAIM sentence:  There was a failure correctly to assimilate the admittedly nuanced advice given by counsel in August  as to the likely interpretation of s of RIPA, and, probably  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xc(c) (d) because of a misunderstanding, it was later misrepresented

CLAIM sentence:  (e) No assessment was made of the impact of the revelations emanating from the Guardian and the New York Times other than in a defensive frame of mind that the decisions taken in  had to be correct (not least because Peter Clarke had made them)

CLAIM sentence:  For Mr Yates to treat this well-researched piece as just another newspaper article is wholly at odds with the immediate reaction of others; outside the police service, they included the Home Secretary, Parliament, the DPP and, incidentally, the PCC

CLAIM sentence:  Whereas I do not believe that Mr Yates was, in fact, influenced in his decision-making by his friendship with Mr Wallis, given the reference to suppressed evidence, the fact that the MPS had not alerted all those whose phones were targeted and the fact that a targeted (albeit comparatively limited) prosecution had been pursued, it was a serious misjudgement to accept responsibility for making a decision affecting the NoTW (particularly one in favour of doing nothing) knowing he was a personal friend of the deputy editor

CLAIM sentence:  It did not need to be him who considered the allegations: it could have been any senior officer

CLAIM sentence:  To make matters worse, Mr Yates dismissed the allegations made by the Guardian in a matter of hours

CLAIM sentence:  He did not give DCS Williams any real opportunity to refresh his memory as to the nuances of what had been a comparatively complex investigation which had concluded just short of three years beforehand

CLAIM sentence:  Neither did he wait for the documents to be retrieved from storage

CLAIM sentence:  At the very least, he accepted at face value that there had been no evidence that journalists other than Mr Goodman had been involved in the criminality and that what leads there might have been were no longer viable

CLAIM sentence:  Even as late as January , Mr Yates was warning the DPP of the risk of presentational embarrassment to both the MPS and the CPS if matters were re-opened

CLAIM sentence:  Even to this day, Mr Yates maintains that it was the provision of new information by NI in January  which warranted the reopening of the investigation and nothing before

CLAIM sentence:  He did not see beyond the need to rebut the suggestion of a police cover-up

CLAIM sentence:  Having said that, I must make it clear that I accept entirely that DCS Williams was acting entirely in good faith; he did not hide evidence or intend to mislead Mr Yates

CLAIM sentence:  Furthermore, although he secured the documents from storage and reviewed the position over the following days, after the press announcement which Mr Yates made on the day of the Guardian report, in reality, a defensive mindset had been engaged and there was no prospect of that decision being revisited

CLAIM sentence:  Having acquitted Mr Yates of being affected by the relationship, there is nothing even to base an allegation of that nature against DCS Williams: I do not impugn the integrity of DCS Williams in any way

CLAIM sentence:  Analysis of unused material for the purposes of disclosure in that case did not involve any assessment of whether others at the NoTW should be investigated or prosecuted and there is no suggestion that they were asked to review the Mulcaire material to advise on whether further investigations should be pursued

CLAIM sentence:  That, as I have made clear, was an operational decision for the police

CLAIM sentence:  Between July  and January , the DPP approached successive revelations in the media with an ever open mind and ever-increasing frustration

CLAIM sentence:  Quite properly, he took the  Chapter  | Phone Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E\xcGuardian article of July  seriously and commissioned appropriate internal enquiries

CLAIM sentence:  He reacted to the for Neville email swiftly and, in the circumstances, reviewing the matter on / July , it is not surprising that Mr Starmer needed urgent advice from Mr Perry

CLAIM sentence:  In that regard, it is unfortunate that Mr Perry did not request further time in order to re-acquaint himself with the relevant facts and law before advising, and that the resultant product did not accurately reflect the advice he had given in August 

CLAIM sentence:  In reality, however, this made little or no difference to the subsequent course of events

CLAIM sentence:  The further allegations in the New York Times caused the DPP to re-evaluate the legal advice: he was then put on the right track

CLAIM sentence:  Given what the police placed before the CPS in relation to Operation Varec, the decision as to prosecution was inevitable

CLAIM sentence:  In January , following the revelations arising from the civil claim brought by Sienna Miller, Mr Starmer reached the point where nothing less than a full review would reassure him that all relevant evidence had been acted on appropriately: that, again, was entirely the correct approach

CLAIM sentence:  I conclude by endorsing the position as articulated by Mr Godwin during his evidence: the police are in a unique position because theyre an institution that can be called upon to investigate any other part of the establishment machinery, if you like, at any time, so in a sense they have to stand slightly apart, and that psychological distance between other institutions and the police

CLAIM sentence:  Its immediate spur was the provision to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) by News International (NI) of what the MPS has characterised as significant new information relating to allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World (NoTW) in -

CLAIM sentence:  Its remit was initially to investigate these allegations, but evidence relating to other dates and print titles is now being considered

CLAIM sentence:  The operation falls under the aegis of the Specialist Crime Directorate (SCD) of the MPS, and at all material times until  October  has been headed by DAC Sue Akers, head of organised crime and criminal networks with the SCD, who has received universal praise for her work

CLAIM sentence:  As DAC Akers has explained in evidence, in its initial phases Operation Weeting focused on seeking to notify the victims and on analysing the numerous pages of the Mulcaire notebooks, which had been seized as part of Operation Caryatid on  August 

CLAIM sentence:  The investigation has entailed going through large quantities of NI business records and emails, seeking evidence relevant to suspicious payments

CLAIM sentence:  As of  October  a total of  individuals had been arrested by officers working on Operation Elveden; of these,  are current and former journalists (including journalists from The Sun; the Daily Mirror and its sister paper, the Sunday Mirror; and the Daily Star Sunday)

CLAIM sentence:  In an important piece of evidence, DAC Akers pointed out that offences of this nature are suspected to have been committed in at least three separate newspaper titles right up to early 

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers expects further arrests to be made in due course

CLAIM sentence:  As at October , Operation Tuleta was undertaking an assessment of  separate allegations of data intrusion, including allegations of phone hacking, computer hacking, and improper access to banking, medical and other personal records

CLAIM sentence:  Some of the information provided by the MSC had been traced to material which appears to have been obtained from two stolen mobile phone devices

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers has said that:  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: pdf  Chapter  | A New Approach to the AllegationsE\xcit seems that on occasions weve found that material has been downloaded from and is in possession of News International titles which appear to have come from stolen mobile telephones

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers has told the Inquiry that it is her firm intention to request further documentation from the MSC in respect of this discovery, with the purpose of establishing: whether in fact these are just isolated incidents or just the tip of an iceberg

CLAIM sentence:  This figure includes a former Times journalist who, on  August , was arrested by Operation Tuleta officers on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act  and conspiracy to pervert to course of justice

CLAIM sentence:  All these individuals are on police bail pending completion of the arrest phase and CPS advice on charging

CLAIM sentence:  In the circumstances that have been described, the MPS grasped the nettle and re-opened the investigation; from the perspective of NI, containment was no longer an option because the reputational risk to News Corporation (News Corp) (let alone NI) required a complete change of direction

CLAIM sentence:  That came in the form of the Management and Standards Committee (MSC) and in July , the board of News Corp appointed the distinguished UK commercial lawyer, Lord Grabiner QC, to the role of Chairman

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Grabiners appointment was made, at least in part, to help ensure the effective exchange of information between NI and the MPS, particularly with regard to the inquiry into alleged  p, lines -, DAC Akers, ibid  p, para , http://www

CLAIM sentence: ui/news/uk/crime/former-times-reporter-patrick-foster-held-over-hacking-

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Grabiner reports to Gerson Zweifach, Senior Executive Vice President and Group General Counsel of News Corp, who was himself appointed to that role in June , taking over that previously held by Joel Klein, formerly Assistant Attorney General of the United States

CLAIM sentence:  Gerson Zweifach in turn reports to the independent directors on the News Corp Board through Professor Viet Dinh, an independent Director and Chairman of News Corps Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and also a former Assistant Attorney General

CLAIM sentence:  In July , two further NI executives (Will Lewis, formally editor-in-chief of the Telegraph Media Group and previously group General Manager at NI, and Simon Greenberg, previously Head of Corporate Affairs) resigned from their positions with NI in order to take up posts with the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  They have been appointed as full time MSC executive members

CLAIM sentence:  News Corps General Counsel for Europe and Asia, Jeff Palker, was appointed to the MSC as a part-time legal executive

CLAIM sentence:  The independence of the MSC from both NI and News Corp is one of its defining characteristics

CLAIM sentence:  This independence is ensured by requiring the MSC to operate its own governance structure, separate to that of News Corp

CLAIM sentence:  Terms of reference and remit The MSC was established by News Corp with a role and remit to investigate allegations of criminality relating to phone hacking at the NoTW and other NI titles

CLAIM sentence:  Specifically, the MSC has been set up to investigate a number of matters including: allegations of phone hacking at the NoTW; allegations of illegal payments made by NI employees to public officials, including police officers; and all other related issues with regard to NI (including this Inquiry)

CLAIM sentence:  The Committee has therefore played a role of fundamental importance to the ongoing criminal and other investigations into the allegations of wrongdoing at NI

CLAIM sentence:  The reason for this new approach is clear

CLAIM sentence:  Quite apart from issues concerned with reputation, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it illegal for any US company to pay bribes to overseas officials and News Corp (the corporate parent of News International) is incorporated in the USA

CLAIM sentence:  Rupert Murdoch told the Inquiry that News Corp (through the MSC) was therefore cooperating fully with the US Department of Justice

CLAIM sentence:  The MSC has been authorised by the News Corp board to investigate practices through a process of internal review at the NI titles, namely The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times

CLAIM sentence:  According to representatives of the MSC, the purpose of this role is to ensure that the highest standards of editorial practices are upheld in future at NI

CLAIM sentence:  This includes ensuring business at the newspaper titles, The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times, are underpinned by robust systems of governance and compliance, as well as a legal structure

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has not heard any evidence in relation to such recommendations made by the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the MSC has also been given the authority to negotiate and settle any civil litigation in relation to phone hacking

CLAIM sentence:  As such it oversees the News International Compensation Scheme for victims in relation to voicemail hacking by the NoTW and it is right that full mention should be made of this willingness by NI to provide informal redress

CLAIM sentence:  The Scheme was announced by NI on  April , following a public apology from the newspaper, their publishing company News Group Newspapers (NGN) as well as NI itself, for the actions of journalists involved in phone hacking at the NoTW

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Charles Gray (formerly a High Court Judge and a very experienced media lawyer) was appointed as the adjudicator of the Scheme

CLAIM sentence:  According to NI, the purpose of the Scheme is to offer an accessible and streamlined process for the victims of voicemail hacking, in order that they might obtain remedial action without the complexities that can be involved in the court process

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the three overarching investigations being undertaken by the MPS, namely Operations Weeting, Elveden (under the supervision of the IPCC) and Tuleta, along with the subsidiary operations that are derived from those, there are the ongoing civil proceedings relating to phone hacking and data hacking and the Parliamentary hearings of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee

CLAIM sentence:  In this regard, in its th Report of Session -, that Committee commented on the cooperation of the MSC at the time of the Parliamentary investigation, praising: the willingness of the newly-established Management and Standards Committee to provide the Committee with unsolicited copies of recently unearthed e-mail exchanges that are of relevance to the events under investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers has sought to explain to the Inquiry the nature and reality of the relationship between the MPS and the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  As an example of the cooperative approach of the MSC toward the MPS investigations, this has included the voluntary disclosure of potential evidence to Operation Elveden, gathered as part of the MSCs internal review of The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  As DAC Akers explained to the Inquiry, however, because of the terms of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act  (PACE) (as to which the Deputy Commissioner of the MPS has made submissions to the Inquiry), the MPS has not been in a position to force compliance

CLAIM sentence:  She stated that: the legal advice that weve had has told us that whilst you have the co-operation of News International, as it is in this case, we must proceed by the way of protocol, and thats what were doing

CLAIM sentence:  So its voluntary disclosure as opposed to applying for a production order through PACE

CLAIM sentence:  pdf; th Report - News International and Phone-Hacking, Volume II, ev, http://www

CLAIM sentence: html  p, para , th Report - News International and Phone-Hacking, Volume I, http://www

CLAIM sentence:  These (and other) arrests since November  have been highly publicised

CLAIM sentence:  In response, Ms Akers explained that the fact that the arrests were carried out without warning was in line with protocols for such investigations, with the primary goal being to secure evidence and prevent suspects from conferring or disposing of evidential material

CLAIM sentence:  She also suggested that arrests had been carried out in a manner intended to minimise business disruption to the newspaper, noting that searches of The Sun offices were conducted on a Saturday, outside of business hours

CLAIM sentence:  She went on to state that: The purpose of police action to date has been proactively to investigate the alleged criminality which has been identified

CLAIM sentence:  The aim has never been to threaten the existence of The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  To this end there has been liaison with the MSC to take account of business risk to The Sun newspaper hence searches being made at The Sun offices on a Saturday when the office would be empty

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers has acknowledged that this approach to the conduct of searches has since been changed, following the launch of The Sun on Sunday

CLAIM sentence:  She reported to the Inquiry her understanding that the MSC had been considering their position in relation to the MPS operations during this hiatus and went on: At the beginning, when we began the enquiries, all contact was through the lawyers; then these were other lawyers, Burton Copeland

CLAIM sentence:  And in mid- May this year, following a development in our investigation, it caused the MSC to reconsider their position and they decided that they would prefer the meetings to be on a more formal basis with lawyers only

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers stressed the importance of full cooperation by the MSC to police operations, and commented that any change in the approach of the voluntary disclosure of evidence would: adversely affect initial decisions that wed made and arrests that were made as well

CLAIM sentence:  The disclosure of documentation by the MSC resumed in mid-June, following discussion between the MPS with Lord Grabiner and the legal team representing the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  At that same meeting, a new framework was agreed in relation to communication

CLAIM sentence:  In response to questions from Mr Jay, DAC Akers has sought to provide a sense of the scale and scope of the material disclosed by the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  She noted that this material related to allegations of data intrusion, including phone hacking, computer hacking and the illegal accessing of other personal data

CLAIM sentence: pdf  To provide context, Ms Akers described a terabyte of data, in terms that if downloaded in the form of a kind of normal-size paperback, which is then piled on top of one another, Im told the terabyte amounts to three and a half times the height of Everest

CLAIM sentence: pdf  PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE\xcChapter  | A New Approach to the Allegations had identified potential payments to individuals related to prison officials, made by staff at both Trinity Mirror Group (TMG) and the Express News Group (the Express)

CLAIM sentence:  Specifically, TMG has asked the MPS to obtain a production pursuant to PACE which it is said will not be opposed; the Express has stated that the company would be prepared voluntarily to share documents through an agreed system, similar to that operated by the MSC; at the time of Ms Akers evidence, no such protocol had been put in place

CLAIM sentence:  Although the MSC operates independently of NI and News Corp, its independence has not gone unchallenged by some witnesses to the Inquiry

CLAIM sentence:  The fact that News Corp was responsible for the establishment of the MSC has led Mr Paddick to believe that the MSC was potentially susceptible to the influence of News Corp executives and staff, and that this alleged influence may have an impact on both its investigations and cooperation with the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Paddick also explained his lack of faith in the credibility in the system of disclosure

CLAIM sentence:  Commenting specifically on the disclosure of evidence by the MSC in relation to the internal review of the practices at The Sun, Mr Paddick said that: The difficulty is and as she (Sue Akers) is saying, for example, all the issues that weve had around the Sun newspaper she never asked for

CLAIM sentence:  it is independent of News International, its not independent of the parent company, as it were requests are put in to this committee by the police

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Paddick has also criticised the lead role of the MPS in the investigations of allegations of corrupt payments made to police officers, as well as public officials

CLAIM sentence:  Although Mr Paddick made specific acknowledgement of the integrity of both DAC Akers and the Commissioner of the MPS, Mr Paddick has made clear that he remained concerned that the MPS could not objectively investigate alleged corruption within their own force

CLAIM sentence:  The suggestion was also raised during Mr Paddicks oral evidence that it would be difficult to find an independent force with senior officers who did not have previous experience at the MPS, but Mr Paddick maintained that this could be achieved, and that it would be better in terms of public perception if the MPS were unaffiliated with the investigation

CLAIM sentence:  He said: it is possible to find ACPO officers who have no previous history with the Metropolitan Police who could lead up this investigation

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Paddick has also voiced concerns at the risk of collusive behaviour between the MPS and NI

CLAIM sentence:  He explained his concerns using a hypothetical example: perhaps somebody very senior in the Metropolitan Police is seen to be having received inappropriate payments from somebody very senior in News International, how it might be in the interests of Rupert Murdoch or News Corp and in the interests of the Metropolitan Police for that not to be made public

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Paddick suggested that it may be possible for the MPS and NI to work together to disguise or hide incriminating evidence in order to protect the reputation of either organisation

CLAIM sentence:  In his response to questions from Counsel to the MPS, Neil Garnham QC, Mr Paddick remained of the view that he had difficulty in having complete confidence in the MPS investigations for the reasons he has elucidated

CLAIM sentence:  DAC Akers has also addressed the concerns raised by Mr Paddick, by emphasising the fundamental importance of the professional and productive relationship the MPS has built with the MSC

CLAIM sentence:  The fact that we are dealing with the MSC directly and not News International I think should make any contention that it isnt independent without foundation

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand, there has been no evidence to support the concerns raised by Mr Paddick, either as to the independence of the MSC or to the impartiality and integrity of the MPS officers responsible for the conduct of its investigation into alleged police corruption and other crime

CLAIM sentence:  The purpose of the MSC has been to re-establish (or establish) a reputation in NI as a company that takes its obligations to the law very seriously and is determined to root out criminality wherever it has existed and whomever it has involved, albeit recognising that some difficult decisions might have to be made in relation to journalistic privilege

CLAIM sentence:  In the light of events, neither News Corp nor NI can do less if the purpose is to be achieved

CLAIM sentence:  It is obviously important that News Corp, NI and the MSC continue in the resolve that has now been shown

CLAIM sentence:  I ought to make it clear that I am not at all critical of Mr Paddick for raising these concerns which I have no doubt are legitimate and ventilated in good faith, based on the history of this investigation and seared by his own experience both of NI and the MPS

CLAIM sentence:  On  May , the MSC announced the completion of its internal reviews of the three NI titles, that is to say The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  This single incident is thought to refer to the activities of the former Times journalist in relation to gaining unlawful access to one or more personal emails

CLAIM sentence:  No further details have been announced in relation to findings of the internal review of The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  Neither has the MSC released further documentation to the MPS following the completion of its review of The Sun

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has not heard any evidence relating to these specific reforms by the MSC, although Thomas Mockridge, Chief Executive Officer of NI, informed the Inquiry in October  that: it is appropriate that compliance within NI be strengthened immediately

CLAIM sentence:  I have therefore not waited for the output of the reviews

CLAIM sentence:  Finally, it is worth noting the costs of the MSC to NI have been borne by the UK subsidiary rather than by News Corp
