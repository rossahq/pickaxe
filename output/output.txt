CLAIM sentence:  In a last attempt to move opinion and secure the support of nine members of the Security Council, Mr Blair decided on  March to propose a short extension of the timetable beyond  March and to revive the idea of producing a side statement setting out a series of tests which would provide the basis for a judgement on Saddam Husseins intentions

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw reported that Secretary Powell thought that there were seven solid votes, and uncertainty about Mexico, Chile and Pakistan

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw replied that he was increasingly coming to the view that we should not push the matter to a vote if we were going to be vetoed; but that had not yet been agreed by Mr Blair

CLAIM sentence:  As Mr Cooks resignation statement on  March made clear, it was possible for a Minister to draw different conclusions from the same information

CLAIM sentence:  Addressing the JIC Assessment of  February , Mr Blair told the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) later that year that: One of the most difficult aspects of this is that there was obviously a danger that in attacking Iraq you ended up provoking the very thing you were trying to avoid

CLAIM sentence:  Most decisions on Iraq preconflict were taken either bilaterally between Mr Blair and the relevant Secretary of State or in meetings between Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, with No

CLAIM sentence:  It wasnt the kind of sofa government in the sense of the Prime Minister and his special advisers and political cronies

CLAIM sentence:  Describing the important function a Cabinet Committee can play, Mr Powell wrote: Most of the important decisions of the Blair Government were taken either in informal meetings of Ministers and officials or by Cabinet Committees

CLAIM sentence:  There was no substantive discussion of the military options, despite promises by Mr Blair, before the meeting on  March

CLAIM sentence:  In January , the Cabinet discussed the proposal to deploy military forces to Helmand later that year

CLAIM sentence: , which is addressed in Section  of the Report, Mr Blair was told that an essential ingredient of the legal basis was that he, himself, should be satisfied of the fact that Iraq was in breach of resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  In accordance with that advice, it was Mr Blair who decided that, so far as the UK was concerned, Iraq was and remained in breach of resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  On  November , Mr Powell told Lord Goldsmith that there should be a meeting some time before Christmas to discuss the legal position

CLAIM sentence:  When Lord Goldsmith met Mr Powell, Sir David Manning and Baroness Morgan (Director of Political and Government Relations to the Prime Minister) on  December, he was told that he was not, at that stage, being asked for his advice; and that, when he was, it would be helpful for him to discuss a draft with Mr Blair in the first instance

CLAIM sentence:  Until  March , Mr Blair and Mr Powell asked that Lord Goldsmiths views on the legal effect of resolution  should be tightly held and not shared with Ministerial colleagues without No

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw was aware, in general terms, of Lord Goldsmiths position but he was not provided with a copy of Lord Goldsmiths draft advice before Cabinet on  January

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith discussed the negotiating history of resolution  with Mr Straw, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, with White House officials and the State Departments Legal Advisers

CLAIM sentence:  At the meeting on  March, Mr Blair stated that Lord Goldsmiths advice made it clear that a reasonable case could be made that resolution  was capable of reviving the authorisation of resolution , although of course a second resolution would be preferable

CLAIM sentence:  On  March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw reached the view that there was no chance of securing a majority in the Security Council in support of the draft resolution of  March and there was a risk of one or more vetoes if the resolution was put to a vote

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on  March: This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Ministers unequivocal view that Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP of UNSCR , because of false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure to comply with, and cooperate fully in the interpretation of, this resolution

CLAIM sentence:  Following receipt of Mr Brummells letter of  March, Mr Blair neither requested nor received considered advice addressing the evidence on which he expressed his unequivocal view that Iraq was in further material breach of its obligations

CLAIM sentence:  When Lord Goldsmith spoke to Mr Brummell on  March, they agreed that a statement should be prepared setting out the Attorneys view of the legal position which could be deployed at Cabinet and in Parliament the following week

CLAIM sentence:  The decision that Lord Goldsmith would take the lead in explaining the Governments legal position to Parliament, rather than the Prime Minister or responsible Secretary of State providing that explanation, was unusual

CLAIM sentence:  The normal practice was, and is, that the Minister responsible for the policy, in this case Mr Blair or Mr Straw, would have made such a statement

CLAIM sentence:  Cabinet was not told how Mr Blair had reached the view recorded in Mr Rycrofts letter

CLAIM sentence:  Cabinet was, however, being asked to confirm the decision that the diplomatic process was at an end and that the House of Commons should be asked to endorse the use of military action to enforce Iraqs compliance

CLAIM sentence:  On  March, Mr Straw decided that a paper on Iraq should be issued before one addressing other countries of concern

CLAIM sentence:  The revised estimates announced by Mr Straw on  May were increasingly presented in Government statements as the benchmark against which Iraq should be judged

CLAIM sentence:  The text was agreed by Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence, at the JIC meeting on  September

CLAIM sentence:  At issue are the judgements made by the JIC and how they and the intelligence were presented, including in Mr Blairs Foreword and in his statement to Parliament on  September 

CLAIM sentence:  By the time the dossier was published, President Bush had announced that the US was seeking action on Iraq through the UN, and Iraq had agreed to the return of inspectors

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair remained concerned about continuing public and Parliamentary criticism of the preconflict intelligence, the failure to find WMD and the decision to invade Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  In April , Mr Blair set up the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR), chaired by Mr Straw, to oversee the UK contribution to postconflict reconstruction

CLAIM sentence:  The conclusions reached by Mr Blair after the invasion did not require the benefit of hindsight

CLAIM sentence:  Between early  and the invasion of Iraq in March , Mr Blair received warnings about: the significance of the postconflict phase as the strategically decisive phase of the engagement in Iraq (in the SPG paper of  December ) and the risk that a badly handled aftermath would make intervention a net failure (in the letter from Mr Hoons Private Office to Sir David Manning of  November ); the likelihood of internal conflict in Iraq (including from Mr Powell on  September , who warned of the need to stop a terrible bloodletting of revenge after Saddam goes

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair told the Chiefs of Staff on  January  that the Issue was aftermath the Coalition must prevent anarchy and internecine fighting breaking out

CLAIM sentence:  In his evidence to the House of Commons Liaison Committee on  January , Mr Blair emphasised the importance of the postconflict phase: You do not engage in military conflict that may produce regime change unless you are prepared to follow through and work in the aftermath of that regime change to ensure the country is stable and the people are properly looked after

CLAIM sentence:  Yet when Mr Blair set out the UKs vision for the future of Iraq in the House of Commons on  March , no assessment had been made of whether that vision was achievable, no agreement had been reached with the US on a workable postconflict plan, UN authorisation had not yet been secured, and there had been no decision on the UNs role in postconflict Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair was already aware that those assumptions concealed significant risks: UK officials assessed that the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), the US body that would assume responsibility for the immediate postinvasion administration of Iraq, was not up to the task

CLAIM sentence:  In the year before the invasion, Mr Blair: stated his belief in the importance of postconflict planning on several occasions, requested advice on aspects of postconflict Iraq (including for his summer including in Cabinet, in Parliament and with President Bush; reading pack in July , for his meeting with President Bush on  January , and twice in February  after reading the JIC Assessment of southern Iraq and the Adelphi Paper Iraq at the Crossroads); at the meeting with Mr Hoon and the Chiefs of Staff on  January , asked the MOD to consider the big what ifs in the specific context of the UK military plan; convened a Ministerial meeting on postconflict issues on  March ; raised concerns about the state of planning with President Bush; and succeeded in the narrow goal of securing President Bushs agreement that the UN should be heavily involved in the postconflict situation, a loose formulation that appeared to bridge the gap between US and UK positions on UN authorisation and the postconflict role of the UN, but did not address the substantive issues

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , the day after the start of the invasion, Mr Powell and Sir David Manning, two of Mr Blairs closest advisers, offered him advice on how to influence the postinvasion US agenda

CLAIM sentence:  By the time resolution  was adopted, the CPA was already operating in Iraq under the leadership of Ambassador L Paul Bremer, reporting to Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary

CLAIM sentence:  The concept of creating a new army had also been raised by Mr Walt Slocombe, CPA Senior Adviser on National Security and Defense, in discussion with Mr Hoon

CLAIM sentence:  This exacerbated concerns about the underresourcing of CPA(South) as expressed in Mr Straws letter to Mr Blair of  June  (see Section 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Sawers alerted the FCO to the first document on  July when it was already at an advanced stage of drafting, and by  July it had been signed off by the Pentagon

CLAIM sentence:  In the absence of decisionmaking arrangements in which the UK had a formal role, too much reliance was placed on communication between Mr Blair and President Bush, one of the very small number of ways of influencing US policy

CLAIM sentence:  But the channel of communication between Prime Minister and President should be reserved for the most strategic and most intractable issues

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Sawers and Sir David Manning expressed concern about whether the UK had sufficient troops deployed in MND(SE), and about the permeability of Maysans substantial border with Iran

CLAIM sentence:  From early July, security was seen in Whitehall as the key concern and was raised by Mr Blair with President Bush

CLAIM sentence:  Despite that evidence, military planning under the leadership of General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, proceeded on the basis that the situation in Basra would remain relatively benign

CLAIM sentence:  When President Bush visited London in November, Mr Blair provided him with a paper written by Sir Jeremy Greenstock which argued that security should be the highest priority in the runup to June , when the Iraqi Transitional Government would take power

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Jeremy suggested that troop levels should be looked at again and highlighted the dangers we face if we do not get a grip on the security situation as a topic that President Bush and Mr Blair needed to discuss in stark terms

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair and President Bush continued to discuss Iraq on a regular basis

CLAIM sentence:  Themes which Mr Blair emphasised to President Bush included the acceleration of Security Sector Reform and the Iraqiisation of security, UN engagement, better outreach to the Sunni community (often referred to as reconciliation), provision of direct support to Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and better use of local media to transmit a positive message about the coalitions intentions and actions

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw raised the need for such a debate with Mr Blair in October

CLAIM sentence:  The impact of the decision to deploy to Helmand on the availability of key equipment capabilities for Iraq, and on the level of stretch felt by military personnel, is addressed in Sections  and 

CLAIM sentence:  In September , Mr Blair expressed his concerns about ISF capability, following reports of police involvement in attacks on the MNF in Basra

CLAIM sentence:  The risk of civil war had been acknowledged by Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari in the wake of the bombing of the alAskari mosque in February

CLAIM sentence:  The Iraq of  certainly did not meet the UKs objectives as described in January : it fell far short of strategic success

CLAIM sentence:  The tactics chosen by Mr Blair were to emphasise the threat which Iraq might pose, rather than a more balanced consideration of both Iraqs capabilities and intent; and to offer the UKs support for President Bush in an effort to influence his decisions on how to proceed

CLAIM sentence:  In public statements at the end of February and in the first week of March , Mr Blair and Mr Straw set out the view that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with

CLAIM sentence:  At Cabinet on  March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that no decisions had been taken and Cabinet was not being asked to take decisions

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blairs Note to President Bush of  July sought to persuade President Bush to use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership with the US and setting out a framework for action

CLAIM sentence: : In discussions with the US over the summer of , Mr Blair and Mr Straw sought to persuade the US Administration to secure multilateral support before taking action on Iraq; and to do so through the UN

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair also decided to publish an explanation of why action was needed The UK made a significant contribution to President Bushs decision, announced Statements made by China, France and Russia after President Bushs speech highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding whether military action was justified

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair and Mr Straw concluded that a second UN resolution would be essential to secure domestic and international support for military action

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair secured President Bushs support for a second resolution but did not secure agreement that the inspections process should continue until the end of March or early April

CLAIM sentence: : By the time the Security Council met on  March  there were deep divisions Following President Bushs agreement to support a second resolution to help within it on the way ahead on Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair, Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued during February and early March  to develop the position that Saddam Hussein was not cooperating as required by resolution  () and, if that situation continued, a second resolution should be adopted stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blairs proposals, on  February, for a side statement defining tough tests for Iraqs cooperation and a deadline of  March for a vote by the Security Council, were not agreed by the US

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair told President Bush that he would need a majority of nine votes in the Security Council for Parliamentary approval for UK military action

CLAIM sentence:  The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October  drew on the ISGs findings, but was not the explanation given before the conflict

CLAIM sentence:  The deployment was dependent on Turkeys agreement to the transit of Mr Blair agreed to offer Package  on  October 

CLAIM sentence:  In the months before the invasion, Mr Blair emphasised the need to minimise the number of civilian casualties arising from an invasion of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  On several occasions, decisionmakers visiting Iraq (including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the General Staff) found the situation on the ground to be much worse than had been reported to them

TOPIC 2 KEY WORDS: security council uk iraq resolution iraqi forces
Number of CLAIMS related to this TOPIC: 228

CLAIM sentence:  Although the Coalition had achieved the removal of a brutal regime which had defied the United Nations and which was seen as a threat to peace and security, it failed to achieve the goals it had set for a new Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The inspectors reported that Iraqi cooperation, while far from perfect, was improving

CLAIM sentence:  The UK shared the broad objective of finding a way to deal with Saddam Husseins defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and his assumed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Government therefore set as its objective the disarmament of Iraq in accordance with the obligations imposed in a series of Security Council resolutions

CLAIM sentence:  After prolonged discussion about the way ahead, the UN Security Council adopted resolution  in December , although China, France and Russia abstained

CLAIM sentence:  The resolution established: a new inspectorate, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) (which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed to lead); a timetable to identify and agree a work programme; and the principle that, if the inspectors reported cooperation in key areas, that would lead to the suspension of economic sanctions

CLAIM sentence:  Resolution  described Iraqs obligations to comply with the disarmament standards of resolution  and other related resolutions as the governing standard of Iraqi compliance; and provided that the Security Council would decide what was required of Iraq for the implementation of each task and that it should be clearly defined and precise

CLAIM sentence:  He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the Iraqi regime

CLAIM sentence:  Through abuse of the UN OilforFood [OFF] programme and smuggling of oil and other goods it was estimated that Saddam Hussein would be able to appropriate in the region of $

CLAIM sentence:  Saddam needed the Iraqi people to suffer to underpin his campaign against sanctions

CLAIM sentence:  He suggested that the approach should be presented as a deal comprising four elements: do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel; tighten weapons controls on Saddam Hussein; retain financial control on Saddam Hussein; and retain our ability to strike

CLAIM sentence:  During the summer of , the UK had been exploring the way forward with the US, Russia and France on a draft Security Council resolution to put in place a smart sanctions regime

CLAIM sentence:  But there was no agreement on the way ahead between the UK, the US, China, France and Russia, the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  The policy was partially successful, but it did not mean that Saddam Hussein was not still developing his [prohibited] programmes

CLAIM sentence:  The UK continued actively to pursue a strengthened policy of containing Iraq, through a revised and more targeted sanctions regime and seeking Iraqs agreement to the return of inspectors as required by resolution  ()

CLAIM sentence:  It entailed renewed demands for Iraq to comply with the obligations imposed by the Security Council and for the readmission of weapons inspectors, and a readiness to respond firmly if Saddam Hussein failed to comply

CLAIM sentence:  This is a regime that agreed to international inspections then kicked out the inspectors

CLAIM sentence:  On  February , Sir Richard Dearlove, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, advised that the US Administration had concluded that containment would not work, was drawing up plans for a military campaign later in the year, and was considering presenting Saddam Hussein with an ultimatum for the return of inspectors while setting the bar so high that Saddam Hussein would be unable to comply

CLAIM sentence:  The following day, the JIC assessed that Saddam Hussein feared a US military attack on the scale of the  military campaign to liberate Kuwait but did not regard such an attack as inevitable; and that Iraqi opposition groups would not act without visible and sustained US military support on the ground

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straws advice of  March proposed that the US and UK should seek an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to readmit weapons inspectors

CLAIM sentence:  By July, no progress had been made on the ultimatum strategy and Iraq was still refusing to admit weapons inspectors as required by resolution  ()

CLAIM sentence:  The potential mismatch between the timetable and work programme for UNMOVIC stipulated in resolution  () and the US plans for military action was recognised by officials during the preparation of the Cabinet Office paper

CLAIM sentence:  If he did, the JIC had advised that Iraq would obstruct the work of the inspectors

CLAIM sentence:  A workable military plan to ensure the collapse of the regime would be required

CLAIM sentence:  The UK was seeking a commitment from the Security Council to take action in the event that Saddam Hussein refused or subsequently obstructed the inspectors

CLAIM sentence:  people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose

CLAIM sentence:  The US Administration had been left in no doubt that the UK Government needed the issue of Iraq to be taken back to the Security Council before it would be able to participate in military action in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  He made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN, the world must hold Iraq to account and the US would work with the UN Security Council for the necessary resolutions

CLAIM sentence:  Statements made by China, France and Russia in the General Assembly debate after President Bushs speech highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding whether military action was justified

CLAIM sentence:  When President Bush made his speech on  September, the US and UK had agreed the broad approach, but not the substance of the proposals to be put to the UN Security Council or the tactics

CLAIM sentence:  They had agreed that the provisions of resolution  () were no longer sufficient to secure the disarmament of Iraq and a strengthened inspections regime would be required

CLAIM sentence:  A new resolution would be needed both to maintain the pressure on Iraq and to define a more intrusive inspections regime allowing the inspectors unconditional and unrestricted access to all Iraqi facilities

CLAIM sentence:  During the negotiations, France and Russia made clear their opposition to the use of force, without firm evidence of a further material breach and a further decision in the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  The UK was successful in changing some aspects of the US position during the negotiations, in particular ensuring that the Security Council resolution was based on the disarmament of Iraq rather than wider issues as originally proposed by the US

CLAIM sentence:  To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of the US and France and Russia (described by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, as irreconcilable), resolution  was a compromise containing drafting fixes

CLAIM sentence:  As the Explanations of Vote demonstrated, there were significant differences between the positions of the members of the Security Council about the circumstances and timing of recourse to military action

CLAIM sentence:  There were also differences about whether Member States should be entitled to report Iraqi noncompliance to the Council

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair, Mr Straw and other senior UK participants in the negotiation of resolution  envisaged that, in the event of a material breach of Iraqs obligations, a second resolution determining that a breach existed and authorising the use of force was likely to be tabled in the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  President Bush is reported to have told a meeting of the US National Security Council on  December , at which the US response to Iraqs declaration was discussed, that the point of the  December declaration was to test whether Saddam Hussein would accept the final opportunity for peace offered by the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  UNSCRs also require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured Kuwaitis and property taken from Kuwait

CLAIM sentence:  In their reports to the Security Council on  February: Dr Blix reported that UNMOVIC had not found any weapons of mass destruction and the items that were not accounted for might not exist, but Iraq needed to provide the evidence to answer the questions, not belittle them

CLAIM sentence:  On  February, the UK, US and Spain tabled a draft resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution  and that the Security Council had decided to remain seized of the matter

CLAIM sentence:  Prior to the inspectors coming back in, Saddam Hussein was engaged in a systematic exercise in concealment of those weapons

CLAIM sentence:  The Government motion was approved by  votes to ;  MPs voted for an amendment which invited the House to find the case for military action against Iraq as yet unproven

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) on  March that it was a matter of fact that Iraq had been in material breach for some weeks and resolution  provided sufficient legal authority to justify military action against Iraq if it was in further material breach

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw also stated that a majority of members of the Security Council had been opposed to the suggestion that resolution  should state explicitly that military action could be taken only if there were a second resolution

CLAIM sentence:  In his report to the Security Council on  March, Dr Blix stated that there had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq since the end of January, but they could not be said to constitute immediate cooperation

CLAIM sentence:  UNMOVIC was drawing up a work programme of key disarmament tasks, which would be ready later that month, for approval by the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:   The number of votes required, in the absence of a veto from one or more of the five Permanent Members, for a decision to take action with the authority of the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  The initiative was pursued through intensive diplomatic activity to lobby for support between London and the capitals of Security Council Member States

CLAIM sentence:  He sought President Bushs support for setting out tests in a side statement, including that the vote in the Security Council might have to be delayed by a couple of days

CLAIM sentence:  In a press conference on  March, Mr Annan reiterated the Security Councils determination to disarm Iraq, but said that every avenue for a peaceful resolution of the crisis had to be exhausted before force should be used

CLAIM sentence:  President Chirac stated that he did not consider that the draft resolution tabled by the US, UK and Spain would attract support from nine members of the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  By  March, it was clear that, in the time available before the US was going to take military action, it would be difficult to secure nine votes in the Security Council for a resolution determining that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair wanted to avoid a gap between the end of the negotiating process and the Parliamentary vote in which France or another member of the Security Council might table a resolution that attracted the support of a majority of the Council

CLAIM sentence:  The UK circulated its draft side statement setting out the six tests to a meeting of Security Council members in New York on the evening of  March

CLAIM sentence:  President Chirac agreed, although the Security Council should make its judgement on the basis of the inspectors report

CLAIM sentence:  In a declaration on  March, France, with Germany and Russia, attempted to secure support in the Security Council for continued inspections

CLAIM sentence:  The joint communiqu contained a final appeal to Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and to the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum

CLAIM sentence:  I know there was never any way Britain was not going to be with the US at that moment, once we went down the UN route and Saddam was in breach

CLAIM sentence:  The subsequent discussion in the Council suggested that only the UK, the US, and Spain took the view that all options other than the use of military force had been exhausted

CLAIM sentence:  In his statement to the House of Commons that evening, Mr Straw said that the Government had reluctantly concluded that Frances actions had put a consensus in the Security Council on a further resolution beyond reach

CLAIM sentence:  As a result of Saddam Husseins persistent refusal to meet the UNs demands, the Cabinet had decided to ask the House of Commons to support the UKs participation in military action, should that be necessary to achieve the disarmament of Iraq and thereby the maintenance of the authority of the United Nations

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw drew attention to the significance of the fact that no one in discussions in the Security Council and outside had claimed that Iraq was in full compliance with its obligations

CLAIM sentence:  The French Presidents office issued a statement early on  March stating that the US ultimatum was a unilateral decision going against the will of the international community who wanted to pursue Iraqi disarmament in accordance with resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  In the Security Council debate on  March, the majority of members of the Security Council, including France, Russia and China, made clear that they thought the goal of disarming Iraq could be achieved by peaceful means and emphasised the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security

CLAIM sentence:  In his view, the issue mattered so much because the outcome would not just determine the fate of the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi people but would: 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair rehearsed the Governments position on Iraqs past pursuit and use of weapons of mass destruction; its failures to comply with the obligations imposed by the UN Security Council between  and ; Iraqs repeated declarations which proved to be false; and the large quantities of weapons of mass destruction which were unaccounted for

CLAIM sentence:  He stated that, based on Iraqs false declaration, its failure to cooperate, the unanswered questions in the UNMOVIC clusters document, and the unaccounted for material, the Security Council should have convened and condemned Iraq as in material breach of its obligations

CLAIM sentence:  If Saddam Hussein continued to fail to cooperate, force should be used

CLAIM sentence:  On  March, the IAEA had reported to the Security Council that there was no indication that Iraq had resumed its nuclear activities

CLAIM sentence:  JIC Assessments had identified the possible stocks of chemical and biological weapons which would largely have been for shortrange, battlefield use by the Iraqi armed forces

CLAIM sentence:  Evidence of contact between Iraq and Usama Bin Laden (UBL) was fragmentary and uncorroborated; including that Iraq had been in contact with Al Qaida for exploratory discussions on toxic materials in late 

CLAIM sentence:  [I] think, one could say this is one of his primary national security concerns given the nature of Al Qaida

CLAIM sentence:  Baroness ManninghamBuller, the Director General of the Security Service from  to , confirmed that position, stating that the Security Service felt there was a pretty good intelligence picture of a threat from Iraq within the UK and to British interests

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Government assessed that Iraq had failed to comply with a series of UN resolutions

CLAIM sentence:  We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years contrary to all history, contrary to all intelligence Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy those weapons

CLAIM sentence:  Iraq had acted suspiciously over many years, which led to the inferences drawn by the Government and the intelligence community that it had been seeking to protect concealed WMD assets

CLAIM sentence:  When the UK sought a further Security Council resolution in March , the majority of the Councils members were not persuaded that the inspections process, and the diplomatic efforts surrounding it, had reached the end of the road

CLAIM sentence:  In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material could be transferred to terrorists, including Al Qaida

CLAIM sentence:   Intelligence and Security Committee, Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction Intelligence and Assessments, September , Cm, paragraph 

CLAIM sentence:   Government Response to the Intelligence and Security Committee Report on Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction Intelligence and Assessments,  September , February , Cm, paragraph 

CLAIM sentence:  This was not, initially, the view of the UK Government

CLAIM sentence:  The declared objectives of the UK and the US towards Iraq up to the time of the invasion differed

CLAIM sentence:  The US was explicitly seeking to achieve a change of regime; the UK to achieve the disarmament of Iraq, as required by UN Security Council resolutions

CLAIM sentence:  The UK wanted UNMOVIC and the IAEA to have time to complete their work, and wanted the support of the Security Council, and of the international community more widely, before any further steps were taken

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Government was right to think very carefully about both of those points

CLAIM sentence:  First, the close strategic alliance with the US has been a cornerstone of the UKs foreign and security policy under successive governments since the Second World War

CLAIM sentence:  The Government was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider alliance with the US very carefully, as previous Governments have done

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to providing a mechanism to probe and challenge the implications of proposals before decisions were taken, a Cabinet Committee or a more structured process might have identified some of the wider implications and risks associated with the deployment of military forces to Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Hoon wrote: At no time when I was serving in the Ministry of Defence were other Cabinet Ministers involved in discussions about the deployment of specific forces and the nature of their operations

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry recognises that there will be operational constraints on discussion of the details of military deployments, but that would not preclude the discussion of the principles and the implications of military options

CLAIM sentence:  Although, when resolution  was adopted, there was unanimous support for a rigorous inspections and monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the means to disarm Iraq, there was no such consensus in the Security Council in March 

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Government was claiming to act on behalf of the international community to uphold the authority of the Security Council, knowing that it did not have a majority in the Security Council in support of its actions

CLAIM sentence:  A determination by the Security Council on whether Iraq was in fact in material breach of resolution  would have furthered the UKs aspiration to uphold the authority of the Council

CLAIM sentence:  He judged a court might well conclude that OPs  and  required a further Security Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr David Brummell (Legal Secretary to the Law Officers) wrote to Mr Matthew Rycroft (Mr Blairs Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs) on  March: It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply  _c Viking_Executive Summary

CLAIM sentence:  That document represented a statement of the Governments legal position it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith told Cabinet that it was plain that Iraq had failed to comply with its obligations and continued to be in material breach of the relevant Security Council resolutions

CLAIM sentence:  Security Council resolutions adopted since  demanded Iraqs disarmament and the readmission of inspectors, and imposed sanctions in the absence of Iraqi compliance with those and other obligations

CLAIM sentence:  But it also served to fuel the demand that the Government should publish the document it was known to have prepared, setting out the reasons why it was so concerned about Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  In the spring and summer of , senior officials and Ministers took the view that the Iraq dossier should not be published until the way ahead on the policy was clearer

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Government intended the information and judgements in the Iraq dossier to be seen to be the product of the JIC in order to carry authority with Parliament and the public

CLAIM sentence:  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons

CLAIM sentence:  It did not say that Iraq had continued to produce weapons

CLAIM sentence:  Nor had the assessed intelligence established beyond doubt that efforts to develop nuclear weapons continued

CLAIM sentence:  From early , the Government drew heavily on the intelligence reporting of Iraqs activities to deceive and obstruct the inspectors to illustrate its conclusion that Iraq had no intention of complying with the obligations imposed in resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  The Government also emphasised the reliability of the reporting

CLAIM sentence:  Almost immediately after the start of the invasion, UK Ministers and officials sought to lower public expectations of immediate or significant finds of WMD in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The Government, still concerned about the nature of the public debate on WMD in the UK, sought to ensure that the Status Report included existing ISG material highlighting the strategic intentions of Saddam Husseins regime and breaches of Security Council resolutions

CLAIM sentence:   Minute CDS to CJO,  March , Op TELIC: Authorisation for Military Operations in Iraq attaching Paper CDS, Chief of Defence Staff Execute Directive to the Joint Commander for Operation TELIC (Phases  and )

CLAIM sentence:  The creation of the Ad Hoc Group on Iraq in September  and the Iraq Planning Unit in February  improved coordination across government at official level, but neither body carried sufficient authority to establish a unified planning process across the four principal departments involved the FCO, the MOD, DFID and the Treasury or between military and civilian planners

CLAIM sentence:  When military planners advised of the need to consider the civilian component as an integral part of the UKs postconflict deployment, the Government was not equipped to respond

CLAIM sentence:  with hindsight, we now see that the military campaign to defeat Saddam was relatively easy; it was the aftermath that was hard

CLAIM sentence:  Significant differences remained between UK and US positions on UN International partners were scarce and thought to be unlikely to come forward UK officials recognised that occupying forces would not remain welcome for long involvement, and between the UK and the UN

CLAIM sentence:  Within its predominantly Shia Area of Operations, the UK assumed that risks to Coalition Forces would be lower than in the socalled Sunni triangle controlled by the US

CLAIM sentence:  Both before and during the invasion Lt Gen Reith made the absence of instructions to UK forces covering what to do if faced with lawless behaviour by the Iraqi population in Basra explicit to the Chiefs of Staff

CLAIM sentence:  Although the implementation of tactical plans to deal with lawlessness was properly the responsibility of intheatre commanders, it was the responsibility of the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chief of Joint Operations to ensure that appropriate Rules of Engagement were set, and preparations made, to equip commanders on the ground to deal with it effectively

CLAIM sentence:  The impact of looting was felt primarily by the Iraqi population rather than by Coalition Forces

CLAIM sentence:  Gen Jackson, Major General David Richards (Assistant Chief of the General Staff) and Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott (Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments)) all offered advice in favour of deploying the UKs  Air Assault Brigade to Baghdad to support Coalition efforts to retrain Iraqi police officers and get them back on patrol

CLAIM sentence:  However, the Chiefs of Staff collectively considered that the benefits of making a contribution to the security of Baghdad were outweighed by the risk that UK troops would be tied down outside the UKs Area of Responsibility, with adverse impact, and  Telegram  IraqRep to FCO London,  June , Iraq: Valedictory: The End of Occupation

CLAIM sentence:  The Chiefs of Staff did not conclude that the tasks it was proposed that  Air Assault Brigade should undertake were unnecessary, but rather that US troops would complete them

CLAIM sentence:  The UK wanted oil revenues to be controlled by an Iraqi body, or failing that by the UN or World Bank, in line with the preinvasion promise to use them exclusively for the benefit of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Instead, resolution  placed the power to spend the Development Fund for Iraq into the hands of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), overseen by a monitoring board

CLAIM sentence:  Resolution  said that the CPA would retain its responsibilities until an internationally recognised representative government was established

CLAIM sentence:  The UKs policy position was that the UN should take the lead in establishing the Interim Iraqi Administration

CLAIM sentence:  No governance arrangements were designed before the invasion which might have enabled officials and Ministers based in London and Washington to manage the implications of a joint occupation involving separate resources of a very different scale

CLAIM sentence:  Senior individuals deployed to Iraq by the UK at this time saw themselves either as working for the CPA in support of its objectives and as part of its chain of command, or as UK representatives within the CPA with a remit to seek to influence CPA decisions

CLAIM sentence: , which dissolved (or disbanded) a number of military and other security entities that had operated as part of Saddam Husseins regime, including the armed forces (see Section )

CLAIM sentence:  The creation of the Iraqi Central Bank as an independent body in July  (see Sections 

CLAIM sentence:  Both used their diplomatic experience to build connections with Iraqi politicians and contribute to the political development of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Instances of UK influence included: Mr Sawers involvement in the plans for an Interim Iraqi Administration, in respect of which he considered that much of the thinking is ours

CLAIM sentence:  Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), reported a decline in Iraqi consent to the Coalition in MND(SE) due to the failure by the Coalition to deliver improvements in essential services and that Shia leaders were warning of a short grace period before further significant deterioration

CLAIM sentence:  The UKs military and civilian representatives on the ground were reporting a growing insurgency in central Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  There was a strong case for reinforcing MND(SE) so that it could handle its highpriority tasks (providing essential security for reconstruction projects, protecting existing infrastructure, guarding key sites and improving border security to inhibit the import of arms from Iran) effectively in changing circumstances

CLAIM sentence:  Increases in UK force levels in order to address the security situation should have been recommended to Ministers

CLAIM sentence:  The bloodiest hour period in Baghdad since March, including an attack on the alRashid Hotel in Baghdads Green Zone, was sufficient to convince some that a pivotal point in the security situation had been reached

CLAIM sentence:  By the end of March, more than  attacks targeting Iraqi citizens were being reported each week

CLAIM sentence:  At the end of April, Mr Blairs analysis was that the key issue in Iraq was not multifaceted, rather it was simple: security

CLAIM sentence:  The Chiefs of Staff maintained the view they had originally reached in November , that HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) should not be actively considered for deployment to Iraq, even though: Iraq was a higher priority for the UK than Afghanistan; security in Iraq was clearly worsening and had been identified by Mr Blair there had been a specific US request for deployment of HQ ARRC

CLAIM sentence:  The most important of the criteria that would enable coalition troops to withdraw was the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the lead on security (Iraqiisation)

CLAIM sentence:  Having recognised that a stable and secure environment was the key factor on which progress in Iraq depended, by May  the UK solution was a better and quicker plan for building Iraqi capacity in the Police, Civil Defence Corps, the Army and the Intelligence Service

CLAIM sentence:  In September, Lieutenant General John McColl (Senior British Military Representative Iraq) judged that the Iraqi Security Forces would not be able to take full responsibility for security before 

CLAIM sentence:  The UK had consistently resisted US requests to deploy additional personnel, which Lt Gen McColl described as having chipped away at the US/UK relationship, but in October it was agreed that the Black Watch would be deployed to North Babil for  days to backfill US forces needed for operations in Fallujah

CLAIM sentence:  Approximately  personnel from st Battalion, the Royal Highland Fusiliers were also deployed to Iraq to provide additional security across MND(SE) during the election period in January and February 

CLAIM sentence:  On  January, elections for the Transitional National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies took place across Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Security arrangements involved , personnel from the Iraqi Security Forces, supported by , troops from the MNFI

CLAIM sentence:  It appears that senior members of the Armed Forces reached the view, throughout  and , that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that it would make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it might have greater effect

CLAIM sentence: , since  the Armed Forces had been consistently operating at or above the level of concurrency defined in the  SDR, and the continuation of Op TELIC had placed additional strain on military personnel

CLAIM sentence:  The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy SubCommittee on Iraq (DOP(I)) recognised that future force levels in Iraq would need to be considered in the context of the requirement to achieve strategic balance with commitments in Afghanistan, to ensure that both were properly resourced

CLAIM sentence:  In July , DOP agreed proposals for both the transfer of the four provinces in MND(SE) to Iraqi control and for the deployment of the UK Provincial Reconstruction Team then based in northern Afghanistan to Helmand province in the South, along with an infantry battlegroup and full helicopter support around , personnel

CLAIM sentence:  As described under the heading Iraqiisation below, the proposals to transfer responsibility for security in the four provinces of MND(SE) to Iraqi control were based on highrisk assumptions about the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the lead for security

CLAIM sentence:  If those assumptions proved to be inaccurate and the UK was unable to withdraw, agreement to the Helmand deployment in Afghanistan effectively constrained the UKs ability to respond by increasing troop levels in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Although Iraq remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of a substantial reinforcement of its forces there, should it have considered one necessary

CLAIM sentence:  After becoming Defence Secretary in May , Dr Reid had continued the policy of reducing UK troop levels based on the transition of lead responsibility for security to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF)

CLAIM sentence:  The proposals for transfer of the four provinces in MND(SE) to Iraqi control agreed in July  suggested transition from MNFI to ISF primacy in Basra from March , based on the assumption that the ISF would, by that point, be capable of taking on responsibility for security in what was likely to remain a very challenging environment

CLAIM sentence:  The critical importance of ISF capability in assessing readiness for transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control, on which UK plans to draw down were based, was emphasised by the Conditions for Provincial Transfer published by the Joint Iraqi/MNF Committee to Transfer Security Responsibility, and by Dr Reid, who told DOP(I) that successful Iraqiisation remains the key

CLAIM sentence:  DOP(I) decided that Dr Reid should have lead responsibility for building the capacity of the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) in Basra in addition to his responsibility for the Iraqi Army

CLAIM sentence:  Gen Walker judged that only  percent of UK military effort in MND(SE) was devoted to counterinsurgency operations

CLAIM sentence:  The security situation at this point should have resulted in a reassessment of the UK troop levels needed to achieve the UKs key outcomes in MND(SE)

CLAIM sentence:  Although the responsibility for tactical decisionmaking rested with commanders on the ground, it was for Gen Walker to ensure that those commanders had sufficient resources to deliver

CLAIM sentence:  The MOD reported to the final DOP(I) meeting of  that the capacity of the Iraqi administration and security forces to assume responsibility, acknowledging the challenge of increasing sectarianism and militia infiltration, was one of the key challenges remaining

CLAIM sentence:  US concerns about UK plans for the transition of Maysan and Muthanna to Iraqi control in May were such that Dr Reid adapted them to include a small residual team providing mentoring and support to the Iraqi Army

CLAIM sentence:  It was only marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilising the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for drawdown

CLAIM sentence:  The exchange of letters between Prime Minister Jaafari and the President of the Security Council which accompanied the resolution clearly identified providing security for the Iraqi people as the reason why a continued MNF presence was necessary

CLAIM sentence:  In late April, FCO officials were concerned that security in Basra was declining and that a determined and sustained effort, including a more assertive military posture, would be required to deliver the UKs objective of transferring Basra to Iraqi control by late  or early 

CLAIM sentence:  After visiting Iraq in early May, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, advised Dr Reid that there should be no change to the operational approach and that there were compelling reasons why the UK should press on with handing over security to Iraq, including to permit the UKs continuing buildup in Afghanistan

CLAIM sentence:  ACM Stirrups view that the UK should press ahead with drawdown despite the security challenges in Basra was not consistent with Government policy that withdrawal should be conditionsbased

CLAIM sentence:   Minute senior government official specialising in the Middle East to Dowse,  May , Situation in Basrah

CLAIM sentence:  In the summer of , in recognition of the need to stabilise Basra and prepare it for transition to Iraqi control, the UK developed the Basra Security Plan, a plan to improve Basra through operations, high impact reconstruction and SSR [Security Sector Reform] 

CLAIM sentence:  While ACM Stirrup stressed the importance of senior Iraqi political support if Op SALAMANCA was to be a success, Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, the Senior British Military Representative Iraq, indicated a concern that even with US support the capabilities available in MND(SE) might not be sufficient successfully to deliver Op SALAMANCA

CLAIM sentence:  The nature of Op SALAMANCA was constrained by the Iraqi Government in September , so that the eventual operation (renamed Operation SINBAD) left Basra in the hands of the militant militia and death squads, with the ISF unable to impose, let alone maintain, the rule of law

CLAIM sentence:  ACM Stirrups strong advice, with which DOP agreed, was that the UK should provide two additional battlegroups to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, reducing the Iraq to Afghanistan battlegroup ratio from : to : and then :

CLAIM sentence:  the Iraqis are increasingly in a position to take on responsibility for their own problems and therefore they might wish to look to propose the south of the country as a model through which we can recommend a drawdown of forces

CLAIM sentence:  When the Charge of the Knights began, the UK found itself to be both compromised in the eyes of the Iraqi Government and unable to offer significant operational support, as a result of the tactical decision to negotiate with JAM and the absence of situational awareness in Basra after withdrawing from the Basra Palace site

CLAIM sentence:  On  April, ACM Stirrup briefed the Overseas and Defence SubCommittee of the National Security, International Relations and Development Committee (NSID(OD)) that the UK military task would be complete by the end of ; its timetable would not be affected by the Charge of the Knights

CLAIM sentence:  Although the UK revisited its Iraq strategy with considerable frequency, no substantial change in approach was ever implemented: UK troop numbers continued to reduce; the size of the civilian deployment varied very little; the Iraqiisation of security and handover of responsibility to the Iraqi Government remained key objectives

CLAIM sentence:  Even as UK troops withdrew from Basra, the US was sufficiently concerned to deploy its own forces there, to secure the border and protect supply lines

CLAIM sentence:  But, as demonstrated by the protracted process of negotiating agreements on the status of US and then UK forces in Iraq, and the continued absence of a muchneeded Hydrocarbons Law, representation did not translate into effective government

CLAIM sentence:  In , Transparency International judged Iraq to be the third most corrupt country in the world, and in mid the Assessments Staff judged that Government ministries were riddled with corruption

CLAIM sentence:  The gap between the ambitious objectives with which the UK entered Iraq and the resources that the Government was prepared to commit to the task was substantial from the start

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore not surprising that, despite the considerable efforts made by UK civilian and military personnel over this period, the results were meagre

CLAIM sentence: : The UK continued to pursue implementation of the smarter economic sanctions regime in the first months of , but continuing divisions between Permanent Members of the Security Council meant there was no agreement on the way forward

CLAIM sentence:  The negotiation of resolution  reflected a broad consensus in the UN To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of the US and France and Russia, resolution  was a compromise containing drafting fixes

CLAIM sentence:  In the absence of a smoking gun, that would require more time and a series of reports from the UN inspectors which established a pattern of Iraqi noncompliance with its obligations

CLAIM sentence:  Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on  March that there had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq and, while they did not constitute immediate cooperation, they were welcome

CLAIM sentence:  UNMOVIC would be proposing a work programme for the Security Councils approval, based on key tasks for Iraq to address

CLAIM sentence:  China, France and Russia all stated that they did not favour a resolution authorising the use of force and that the Security Council should maintain its efforts to find a peaceful solution

CLAIM sentence:  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt either that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons or that efforts to develop nuclear weapons continued

CLAIM sentence:  The widespread perception that the September  dossier overstated the firmness of the evidence has produced a damaging legacy which may make it more difficult to secure support for Government policy, including military action, where the evidence depends on inferential judgements drawn from intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  invasion, Saddam Hussein had taken a different position

CLAIM sentence:  There were soon demands for an independent judgeled inquiry into the The Government was quick to acknowledge the need for a review, rejecting preconflict intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on  March: It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of resolution  and has thus failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council in that resolution

CLAIM sentence: : The size and composition of a UK military contribution to the USled invasion of Iraq was largely discretionary

CLAIM sentence:  By that time, in any case, the US had asked the UK to deploy for operations in southern Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  also underestimated the need for sustained communication of key strategic messages to inform public opinion about the objectives and progress of the military campaign, including in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The UK missed clear opportunities to reconsider its military approach in Throughout  and , it appears that senior members of the Armed MultiNational Division (SouthEast)

CLAIM sentence:  Although Iraq remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of a substantial reinforcement of its forces there

CLAIM sentence:  The UKs plans to reduce troop levels depended on the transition of lead responsibility for security to the Iraqi Security Forces, even as the latters ability to take on that responsibility was in question

CLAIM sentence:  At key points, DFID should have considered strategic questions about the scale, The USled Coalition Provisional Authority excluded the UK from discussions on oil policy and on disbursements from the Development Fund for Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Witnesses to the Inquiry identified some successes, in particular in building the capacity of central Iraqi Government institutions and the provincial government in Basra

CLAIM sentence:  Lessons learned through successive reviews of the UK approach to postconflict reconstruction and stabilisation, in Iraq and elsewhere, were not applied in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The focus on the quantity of officers trained for the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than the quality of officers, was simplistic and gave a misleading sense of comfort

CLAIM sentence:  After , the UKs determination to withdraw from Iraq meant that aspirations for the Iraqi Security Forces were lowered to what would be good enough for Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  There was no articulated need for additional financial resources for military The arrangements for funding military Urgent Operational Requirements and other military costs worked as intended, and did not constrain the UK militarys ability to conduct operations in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The controls imposed by the Treasury on the MODs budget in September  The Government was slow to recognise that Iraq was an enduring operation, and to adapt its funding arrangements to support both military operations and civilian activities

CLAIM sentence: : Between  and , UK forces in Iraq faced gaps in some key capability areas, including protected mobility, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) and helicopter support

CLAIM sentence:  The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan had a material impact on the availability of key capabilities for deployment to Iraq, particularly helicopters and ISTAR

CLAIM sentence:  Before the invasion of Iraq, the Government had made only minimal There was an enduring gap between the Governments civilian capacity and There was no overarching consideration by the Government of the extent to which civilians could be effective in a highly insecure environment, or of the security assets needed for civilians to do their jobs effectively

CLAIM sentence:  The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that the Government recognised its duty of care to UKbased and locally engaged civilians in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  More time was devoted to the question of which department should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than it was to efforts to determine the actual number

CLAIM sentence:  The Governments consideration of the issue of Iraqi civilian casualties was driven by its concern to rebut accusations that Coalition Forces were responsible for the deaths of large numbers of civilians, and to sustain domestic support for operations in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Once an issue becomes a matter for the Security Council, the UK Government cannot expect to retain control of how it is to be discussed and eventually decided unless it is able to work with the interests and agendas of other Member States

CLAIM sentence:  A military timetable should not be allowed to dictate a diplomatic timetable

CLAIM sentence:  Know your enemy How the Joint Intelligence Committee saw the World

CLAIM sentence:  By the end of March, the Government had recognised the need for sustained communication of key strategic messages and improved capabilities to reach a range of audiences in the UK, Iraq and the wider international community

CLAIM sentence:  But there was clearly a need for more robust arrangements to integrate Coalition efforts in the UK, US and the forces deployed in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The direction in the Ministerial Code that the estimate of a cost of a proposal should be included in the memorandum submitted to Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee applies equally to military operations

CLAIM sentence:  In developing strategies and plans for civilian/military operations, a government should address the impact of the different mechanisms used to fund military operations and civilian activities and the extent to which those mechanisms provide perverse incentives for military action by making it easier to secure funding for agreed military operations than for civilian activities

CLAIM sentence:  A government should also address its explicit and implicit financial policy that, while there should be no constraint on the provision of funding for military operations, it is reasonable that for the same civilian/military operation, departments should find funding for new civilian activities from within their existing budgets, which are likely to be fully allocated to existing departmental priorities

CLAIM sentence:  A government is likely to embark on major civilian/military operations such as Iraq only rarely

CLAIM sentence:  A government should recognise that, in such operations, the civilian components (including diplomatic activity, reconstruction and Security Sector Reform) will be critical for strategic success, may be very substantial, and must be properly resourced

CLAIM sentence:  In deciding to undertake concurrent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the UK knowingly exceeded the Defence Planning Assumptions

CLAIM sentence:  Any decision which commits the UK to extended operations in excess of the Defence Planning Assumptions should be based on the most rigorous analysis of its potential implications, including for the availability of relevant capabilities for UK forces

CLAIM sentence:  The effectiveness of the UK civilian effort in postconflict Iraq was compromised by a range of factors, including the absence of effective crossgovernment coordination on risk, duty of care and the terms and conditions applicable to personnel serving in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The framework should provide the means for the Government as a whole to strike an effective balance between security and operational effectiveness, and to take timely decisions on the provision of appropriate security measures

CLAIM sentence:  Standardising tour lengths for civilians deployed by different departments would have eased the overall administrative burden and, perhaps, some of the tensions between individuals from different government departments serving in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair set out his concerns about: proliferators of nuclear equipment or expertise; dictatorships with highly repressive regimes who were desperately trying to acquire chemical, biological or, particularly, nuclear weapons capability some of those were a short time away from having a serviceable nuclear weapon, and that activity was increasing, not diminishing; and the possibility of terrorist groups obtaining and using weapons of mass destruction, including a radiological bomb

CLAIM sentence:  The September dossier stated that Iraq could produce a nuclear weapon within one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other essential components  _c Viking_Executive Summary

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC had also judged in the September dossier that Iraq was producing chemical and biological agents and that there were development programmes for longerrange missiles capable of delivering them

CLAIM sentence:  Instead of disarming as these resolutions had demanded, Iraq was assessed to have concealed materials from past inspections and to have taken the opportunity of the absence of inspections to revive its WMD programmes

CLAIM sentence:  The Al Samoud  missiles which exceeded the range permitted by the UN, were The IAEA had concluded that there was no Iraqi nuclear programme of any The inspectors believed that they were making progress and expected to The inspectors were preparing to step up their activities with U flights and achieve more cooperation from Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  They did not need to be  _c Viking_Executive Summary

CLAIM sentence:  commissioned the preparation of a paper to inform the public about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and WMD more generally in four key countries of concern, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The dossier drew on the  September JIC Assessment, Iraqi Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons Possible Scenarios, which had been commissioned to address scenarios for Iraqs possible use of chemical and biological weapons in the event of military action, previous JIC Assessments and the subsequent report issued by SIS on  September

CLAIM sentence:  In the Foreword, Mr Blair stated that he believed the assessed intelligence had established beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that he had been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme

CLAIM sentence:  It also stated that Iraq had the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC stated in the Executive Summary of the dossier that Iraq had: in the production of nuclear weapons; made covert attempts to acquire technology and materials which could be used sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having no active recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme

CLAIM sentence:  The absence of evidence of proscribed programmes and materials relating to the production or delivery of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons was attributed to Iraqs ability to conceal its activities and deceive the inspectors and the difficulties which it had been anticipated the inspectors would encounter

CLAIM sentence:  A key element of the Assessments was the reporting and intelligence on Iraqs intentions to conceal its activities, deceive the inspectors and obstruct the conduct of inspections, particularly Iraqs attitudes to preventing interviews with officials who were  _c Viking_Executive Summary

Number of CLAIMS related to this TOPIC: 283

CLAIM sentence:  The consequences of the invasion and of the conflict within Iraq which followed are still being felt in Iraq and the wider Middle East, as well as in the UK

CLAIM sentence:  The decision to use force a very serious decision for any government to take provoked profound controversy in relation to Iraq and became even more controversial when it was subsequently found that Iraqs programmes to develop and produce chemical, biological and nuclear weapons had been dismantled

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquirys report sets out in detail decisionmaking in the UK Government covering the period from when the possibility of military action first arose in  to the departure of UK troops in 

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the factors that shaped the decision to take military action in March  without support for an authorising resolution in the UN Security Council, they are: the assessments of Iraqi WMD capabilities by the intelligence community prior to the invasion (including their presentation in the September  dossier); advice on whether military action would be legal; the lack of adequate preparation for the postconflict period and the consequent struggle to cope with the deteriorating security situation in Iraq after the invasion

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Government sought to influence the decisions of the US Administration and avoid unilateral US military action on Iraq by offering partnership to the US and seeking to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat with which it was necessary to deal

CLAIM sentence:  To do so required the UK to reconcile its objective of disarming Iraq, if possible by peaceful means, with the US goal of regime change

CLAIM sentence:  That was achieved by the development of an ultimatum strategy threatening the use of force if Saddam Hussein did not comply with the demands of the international community, and by seeking to persuade the US to adopt that strategy and pursue it through the UN

CLAIM sentence:  President Bushs decision, in September , to challenge the UN to deal with Iraq, and the subsequent successful negotiation of resolution  giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations or face serious consequences if it did not, was perceived to be a major success for Mr Blairs strategy and his influence on President Bush

CLAIM sentence:  Following the Iraqi declaration of  December , the UK perceived that President Bush had decided that the US would take military action in early  if Saddam Hussein had not been disarmed and was still in power

CLAIM sentence:  The UK Governments efforts to secure a second resolution faced opposition from those countries, notably France, Germany and Russia, which believed that the inspections process could continue

CLAIM sentence:  It could act with the US but without the support of the majority of the Security Council in taking military action if Saddam Hussein did not accept the US ultimatum giving him  hours to leave

CLAIM sentence:  Before the attacks on the US on  September  (/), the UK was pursuing a strategy of containment based on a new sanctions regime to improve international support and incentivise Iraqs cooperation, narrowing and deepening the sanctions regime to focus only on prohibited items and at the same time improving financial controls to reduce the flow of illicit funds to Saddam Hussein

CLAIM sentence:  A policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international support

CLAIM sentence:  Saddam suspects he is able to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained in power; provisions

CLAIM sentence:  In December , the British Embassy Washington reported growing pressure to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by President Clinton

CLAIM sentence:  Encouraged by the success of Iraqs border trade agreement with Turkey, There had been a significant increase in the erosion of sanctions over frontline states were not enforcing sanctions

CLAIM sentence:  The stated position of the UK Government in February  was that containment had been broadly successful

CLAIM sentence:  They showed that attacks intended to cause largescale civilian casualties could be mounted anywhere in the world

CLAIM sentence:  In response to that perception of a greater threat, governments felt a responsibility to act to anticipate and reduce risks before they turned into a threat

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC assessed on  September that the attacks on the US had set a new benchmark for terrorist atrocity, and that terrorists seeking comparable impact might try to use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear devices

CLAIM sentence:  But support for economic sanctions was eroding and whether Iraq would ever agree to readmit weapons inspectors and allow them to operate without obstruction was in doubt

CLAIM sentence:  He sought to prevent precipitate military action by the US which he considered would undermine the success of the coalition which had been established for action against international terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  This would build over time until the point was reached where military action could be taken if necessary, without losing international support

CLAIM sentence:  The strategy was based on the premise that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with, and it had multiple diplomatic strands

CLAIM sentence:  The strategy included mounting covert operations in support of those with the ability to topple Saddam

CLAIM sentence:  By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger

CLAIM sentence:  The discussion in Cabinet was couched in terms of Iraqs need to comply with its obligations, and future choices by the international community on how to respond to the threat which Iraq represented

CLAIM sentence:  He proposed that the UK and the US should pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the return of weapons inspectors or face the consequences

CLAIM sentence:  The US should take action within a multilateral framework with international support, not unilateral action

CLAIM sentence:  A public information campaign should be mounted to explain the nature Any military action would need to be within the framework of international law

CLAIM sentence:  The military strategy would need to ensure Saddam Hussein could be removed A convincing blueprint was needed for a postSaddam Hussein Iraq which The US should advance the Middle East Peace Process in order to improve the chances of gaining broad support in the Middle East for military action against Iraq; and to preempt accusations of double standards

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair considered that he was seeking to influence US policy by describing the key elements for a successful strategy to secure international support for any military action against Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Key Ministers and some of their most senior advisers thought these were the conditions that would need to be met if the UK was to participate in USled military action

CLAIM sentence:  To provide the basis for a discussion with the US, a Cabinet Office paper of  July, Iraq: Conditions for Military Action, identified the conditions which would be necessary before military action would be justified and the UK could participate in such action

CLAIM sentence:  that the UK would support military action to bring about regime change, provided that certain conditions were met: efforts had been made to construct a coalition/shape public opinion, the IsraelPalestine Crisis was quiescent, and the options for action to eliminate Iraqs WMD through the UN weapons inspectors had been exhausted

CLAIM sentence:  The Cabinet Office paper also identified the need to address the issue of whether the benefits of military action would outweigh the risks

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Richard Dearlove reported that he had been told that the US had already taken a decision on action the question was only how and when; and that he had been told it intended to set the threshold on weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be able to hold up US policy

CLAIM sentence:  Further advice and background material were commissioned, including on the possibility of a UN ultimatum to Iraq and the legal basis for action

CLAIM sentence:  The record stated: We should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military action

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair was advised that there would be formidable obstacles to securing a new UN resolution incorporating an ultimatum without convincing evidence of a greatly increased threat from Iraq

CLAIM sentence:   Letter McDonald to Rycroft,  July , Iraq: Ultimatum attaching Paper Elements which might be incorporated in an SCR embodying an ultimatum to Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  In late August, the FCO proposed a strategy of coercion, using a UN resolution to issue an ultimatum to Iraq to admit the weapons inspectors and disarm

CLAIM sentence:  In his speech to the General Assembly on  September, President Bush set out his view of the grave and gathering danger posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged the UN to act to address Iraqs failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security Council since 

CLAIM sentence:  In his statement to Parliament on  September and in his answers to subsequent questions, Mr Blair presented Iraqs past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraqs weapons of mass destruction

CLAIM sentence:  There were significant differences between the US and UK positions, and between them and China, France and Russia about the substance of the strategy to be adopted, including the role of the Security Council in determining whether peaceful means had been exhausted and the use of force to secure disarmament was justified

CLAIM sentence:  The UK initially formulated the objective in terms of: a resolution setting out an ultimatum to Iraq to readmit the UN weapons a threat to resort to the use of force to secure disarmament if Iraq failed inspectors and to disarm in accordance with its obligations; and to comply

CLAIM sentence:  That created deliberate ambiguities on a number of key issues including: a material breach; the level of noncompliance with resolution  which would constitute by whom that determination would be made; and whether there would be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use of force

CLAIM sentence:  Iraq also restated its position that it had neither produced nor was in possession of weapons of mass destruction since the inspectors left in December 

CLAIM sentence:  Following Iraqs submission of the declaration on its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes to the UN on  December, and before the inspectors had properly begun their task, the US concluded that Saddam Hussein was not going to take the final opportunity offered by resolution  to comply with his obligations

CLAIM sentence:  The JICs initial Assessment of the Iraqi declaration on  December stated that there had been No serious attempt to answer any of the unresolved questions highlighted by the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) or to refute any of the points made in the UK dossier on Iraqs WMD programme

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell on  December that the US and UK should develop a clear plan B postponing military action on the basis that inspections plus the threat of force were containing Saddam Hussein

CLAIM sentence:  War and Decision: Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  In early , Mr Straw still thought a peaceful solution was more likely than military action

CLAIM sentence:  to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles 

CLAIM sentence:  In January , there was a clear divergence between the UK and US Government positions over the timetable for military action, and the UK became increasingly concerned that US impatience with the inspections process would lead to a decision to take unilateral military action in the absence of support for such action in the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  If he was not, that would be a sufficient reason for military action

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair continued to set the need for action against Iraq in the context of the need to be seen to enforce the will of the UN and to deter future threats

CLAIM sentence:  He proposed focusing on the absence of full cooperation and a simple resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity, with a side statement defining tough tests of cooperation and a vote on  March to provide a deadline for action

CLAIM sentence:  Dr Blix stated that full cooperation was a nebulous concept; and a deadline of  April would be too early

CLAIM sentence:  The House of Commons was asked on  February to reaffirm its endorsement of resolution , support the Governments continuing efforts to disarm Iraq, and to call upon Iraq to recognise that this was its final opportunity to comply with its obligations

CLAIM sentence:  officials on  February that the safest legal course for future military action would be to secure a further Security Council resolution

CLAIM sentence:  He had, however, reached the view that a reasonable case could be made that resolution  was capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in resolution  () without a further resolution, if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  An Arab League Summit on  March concluded that the crisis in Iraq must be resolved by peaceful means and in the framework of international legitimacy

CLAIM sentence:  France, Germany and Russia stated on  March that they would not let a resolution pass that authorised the use of force

CLAIM sentence:  The British Embassy Washington reported overnight on / March that barring a highly improbable volte face by Saddam, the US was now firmly on track for military action and would deal firmly with any efforts in the UN to slow down the timetable

CLAIM sentence:  The UK, US and Spain circulated a revised draft resolution deciding that Iraq would have failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution  () unless  Telegram  Washington to FCO London,  March , Personal Iraq: UN Endgame

CLAIM sentence:  the more he had looked into the Iraq dossier [issue] the more convinced he had become of the need for action

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw set out the UK thinking on a deadline, stating that this was Iraqs last chance, but the objective was disarmament and, if Saddam Hussein did what was demanded, he could stay

CLAIM sentence:  By  March, President Bushs position was hardening and he was very reluctant to delay military action

CLAIM sentence:  There was both UK and US intelligence warning us of the risk

CLAIM sentence:  They were starting to say they would not support military action in any circumstances, irrespective of what the inspectors found 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Annan also warned that, if the Security Council failed to agree on a common position and action was taken without the authority of the Council, the legitimacy and support for any such action would be seriously impaired

CLAIM sentence:  In response to a question asking, And, this evening, this is your position in principle?, President Chirac responded: My position is that, regardless of the circumstances, France will vote no because she considers this evening that there are no grounds for waging war in order to achieve the goal we have set ourselves, that is to disarm Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The political and diplomatic consequences for the UK would be significantly worse to have our 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw also identified the need for a Plan B for the UK not to participate in military action in the event that the Government failed to secure a majority in the Parliamentary Labour Party for military action

CLAIM sentence:  Reporting discussions in New York on  March on the draft resolution and details of a possible side statement, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain on  March had no chance 

CLAIM sentence:  That could have undermined the UK (and US) position on its legal basis for action

CLAIM sentence:  It was in contradiction of the Security Councils earlier view that military action would follow if Iraq did not fully and unconditionally cooperate with the inspectors

CLAIM sentence:  The main objections had included the perceived authorisation of force in the draft resolution and a desire to wait for UNMOVICs own list of key tasks which would be issued early the following week

CLAIM sentence: pm UK time on  March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock announced that the resolution would not be put to a vote, stating that the cosponsors reserved the right to take their own steps to secure the disarmament of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  To disregard the legitimacy of the UN, to favour force over the law, would be to take on a heavy responsibility

CLAIM sentence:  On the evening of  March, the House of Commons passed by  votes to  a motion supporting the decision of Her Majestys Government that the United Kingdom should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraqs weapons of mass destruction

CLAIM sentence:  should lose no opportunity to propagate the reason, at every level and as widely as possible, why we had arrived at a diplomatic impasse, and why it was necessary to take action against Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  He deployed a wide range of arguments to explain the grounds for military action and to make a persuasive case for the Governments policy

CLAIM sentence:  On  March , the House of Commons was asked: to recognise that Iraqs weapons of mass destruction and longrange missiles, and its continuing noncompliance with Security Council resolutions, posed a threat to international peace and security; and  Ministry of Defence, Operations in Iraq: Lessons for the Future, December , page 

CLAIM sentence:  In his statement, Mr Blair addressed both the threat to international peace and security presented by Iraqs defiance of the UN and its failure to comply with its disarmament obligations as set out in resolution  ()

CLAIM sentence:  would any tyrannical regime possessing weapons of mass destruction think when viewing the history of the worlds diplomatic dance with Saddam over 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair also described a threat of chaos and disorder arising from tyrannical regimes with weapons of mass destruction and extreme terrorist groups prepared to use them

CLAIM sentence:  The possibility of the two coming together of terrorist groups in possession of weapons of mass destruction or even of a so called dirty radiological bomb is now in my judgement, a real and present danger to Britain and its national security

CLAIM sentence:  JIC Assessments, reflected in the September  dossier, had consistently taken the view that, if sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would take Iraq at least five years following the end of sanctions to produce enough fissile material for a weapon

CLAIM sentence:  Saddam Husseins regime had the potential to proliferate material and knowhow, to terrorist groups, but it was not judged likely to do so

CLAIM sentence:  On  February , the JIC judged that Al Qaida would not carry out attacks under Iraqi direction

CLAIM sentence:  I think it would be fair to say that the Prime Minister was very worried about the possible conjunction of terrorism and WMD, but not specifically in relation to Iraq 

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC Assessment of  October  stated that Saddam Husseins overriding objective was to avoid a US attack that would threaten his regime

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC judged that, in the event of USled military action against Iraq, Saddam would: 

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC also judged that: Saddams capability to conduct effective terrorist attacks was very limited

CLAIM sentence:  Sir David Omand, the Security and Intelligence Coordinator in the Cabinet Office from  to , told the Inquiry that, in March , the Security Service judged that the threat from terrorism from Saddams own intelligence apparatus in the event of an intervention in Iraq 

CLAIM sentence:  This construct remained influential despite the lack of significant finds by inspectors in the period leading up to military action in March , and even after the Occupation of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Iraq continues to deny that it has any weapons of mass destruction, although What is perfectly clear is that Saddam is playing the same old games in no serious intelligence service anywhere in the world believes it

CLAIM sentence:  neither the international community nor the British public is persuaded that Over the past decade that strategy [of containment] had destroyed more there is an urgent and compelling reason for this military action in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term namely a credible device capable of being delivered against a strategic city target

CLAIM sentence:  Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and which we helped to create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddams ambition to complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of UN inspectors? 

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair had been advised that an invasion of Iraq was expected to increase the threat to the UK and UK interests from Al Qaida and its affiliates

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC judged in October  that the greatest terrorist threat in the event of military action against Iraq will come from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists; and they would be pursuing their own agenda

CLAIM sentence:  In response to a call for Muslims everywhere to take up arms in defence of Iraq issued by Usama Bin Laden on  February, and a further call on  February for compulsory jihad by Muslims against the West, the JIC Assessment on  February predicted that the upward trend in the reports of threats to the UK was likely to continue

CLAIM sentence:  On the other hand I think you had to ask the question, Could you really, as a result of that fear, leave the possibility that in time developed into a nexus between terrorism and WMD in an event? This is where youve just got to make your judgement about this

CLAIM sentence:  our involvement in Iraq radicalised, for want of a better word 

CLAIM sentence:  Asked about the proposition that it was right to remove Saddam Husseins regime to forestall a fusion of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism at some point in the future, and if it had eliminated a threat of terrorism from his regime, Baroness ManninghamBuller replied: It eliminated the threat of terrorism from his direct regime; it didnt eliminate the threat of terrorism using unconventional methods 

CLAIM sentence:  Asked if a war in Iraq would aggravate the threat from whatever source to the United Kingdom, Baroness ManninghamBuller stated that that was the view communicated by the JIC Assessments

CLAIM sentence:  Asked whether the judgement that the effect of the invasion of Iraq had increased the terrorist threat to the UK was based on hard evidence or a broader assessment, Baroness ManninghamBuller replied: I think we can produce evidence because of the numerical evidence of the number of plots, the number of leads, the number of people identified, and the correlation of that to Iraq and statements of people as to why they were involved 

CLAIM sentence:  But I took the view then and take the same view now that to have backed down because of the threat of terrorism would be completely wrong

CLAIM sentence:  It was the US Administration which decided in late  to make dealing with the problem of Saddam Husseins regime the second priority, after the ousting of the Taliban in Afghanistan, in the Global War on Terror

CLAIM sentence:  It did so essentially for two reasons: be damaged if the UK did not give the US its full support over Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Concern that vital areas of cooperation between the UK and the US could The belief that the best way to influence US policy towards the direction preferred by the UK was to commit full and unqualified support, and seek to persuade from the inside

CLAIM sentence:  After the attacks on the US on  September , that relationship was reinforced when Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand shoulder to shoulder with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  The action that followed in Afghanistan to bring about the fall of the Taliban served to strengthen and deepen the sense of shared endeavour

CLAIM sentence:  When the US Administration turned its attention to regime change in Iraq as part of the second phase of the Global War on Terror, Mr Blairs immediate response was to seek to offer a partnership and to work with it to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with

CLAIM sentence:  The second reason for committing unqualified support was, by standing alongside and taking part in the planning, the UK would be able to influence US policy

CLAIM sentence:  Similarly, Lord Wilson stated that, between  September  and January , the Governments response to international terrorism and the subsequent military action against the Taliban in Afghanistan had been managed through  Ministerial meetings

CLAIM sentence:   Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction [The Butler Report],  July , HC 

CLAIM sentence:  Those were: The decision at the beginning of December  to offer to work with President Bush on a strategy to deal with Iraq as part of Phase  of the War on Terror, despite the fact that there was no evidence of any Iraqi involvement with the attacks on the US or active links to Al Qaida

CLAIM sentence:  The adoption of the position at the end of February  that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with, together with the assumption that the only certain means to remove Saddam Hussein and his regime was to invade Iraq and impose a new government

CLAIM sentence:  Any military action taken against President Saddam Husseins regime had to be effective

CLAIM sentence:  The international community should proceed in a measured but determined way to decide how to respond to the real threat represented by the Iraqi regime

CLAIM sentence:  No decisions to launch military action had been taken and any action taken would be in accordance with international law

CLAIM sentence:  In Section  of the Report, the Inquiry concludes that Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which fully reflected the position on  March and explained the legal basis on which the UK could take military action and set out the risks of legal challenge

CLAIM sentence:  It was not until  March  that Lord Goldsmith advised that there was, on balance, a secure legal basis for military action

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry was told, and it accepts, that it would have been possible at that stage for the UK Government to have decided not to go ahead with military action if it had been necessary to make a decision to do so; or if the House of Commons on  March had voted against the Government

CLAIM sentence:  The instructions made it clear that Lord Goldsmith should not provide an immediate response

CLAIM sentence:  They argued that resolution  could be interpreted as not requiring a second resolution

CLAIM sentence:  officials on  February, he told them that he had reached the view that a reasonable case could be made that resolution  was capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in resolution  () without a further resolution, if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  could not have been sure that Lord Goldsmith would advise that there was a basis on which military action against Iraq could be taken in the absence of a further decision of the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith noted that on a number of previous occasions, including in relation to Operation Desert Fox in Iraq in  and Kosovo in , UK forces had participated in military action on the basis of advice from previous Attorneys General that (paragraph ) the legality of the action under international law was no more than reasonably arguable

CLAIM sentence:  the argument that resolution  alone has revived the authorisation to use force in resolution  will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq failed to take the final opportunity

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith added: In the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC, you will need to consider extremely carefully whether the evidence of noncooperation and noncompliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith concluded on  March that, on balance, the better view was that the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this case, meaning that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further resolution beyond resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as the advice of  March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding the legal effect of resolution  and whether, in particular, it authorised military action without a further resolution of the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which fully reflected the position on  March, explained the legal basis on which the UK could take military action and set out the risks of legal challenge

CLAIM sentence:  The advice should have addressed the significance of the exchange of letters of  and  March and how, in the absence of agreement from the majority of members of the Security Council, the point had been reached that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  Agreement to those resolutions indicated that doubts about whether Iraq had disarmed were widely shared

CLAIM sentence:  In parallel, by , the wider risk of proliferation was regarded as a major threat

CLAIM sentence:  There was heightened concern about: nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; and the danger of proliferation, particularly that countries of concern might obtain the potential risk that terrorist groups which were willing to use them might gain access to chemical and biological agents and, possibly, nuclear material, and the means to deliver them

CLAIM sentence:  Iraqs chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a threat to international peace and security in the Middle East region, but Iraq was viewed as a less serious proliferation threat than other key countries of concern Iran, Libya and North Korea which had current nuclear programmes

CLAIM sentence:  When the preparation of this document became public knowledge, it was perceived to be intended to underpin a decision on military action against Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Reflecting the UK position that action was needed to disarm Iraq, Mr Blair and Mr Straw began, from late February , publicly to argue that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed in accordance with the  _c Viking_Executive Summary

CLAIM sentence:  When he saw the draft paper on WMD countries of concern on  March, Mr Straw commented: Good, but should not Iraq be first and also have more text? The paper has to show why there is an exceptional threat from Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  On  March, Mr Straw was advised that the evidence would not convince public opinion that there was an imminent threat from Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public, from late  onwards, about Iraqs proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed were understandably written in more direct and less nuanced language than the JIC Assessments on which they drew

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraqs weapons of mass destruction without addressing their nature (the type of warhead and whether they were battlefield or strategic weapons systems) or how they might be used (as a last resort against invading military forces or as a weapon of terror to threaten civilian populations in other countries) was likely to have created the impression that Iraq posed a greater threat than the detailed JIC Assessments would have supported

CLAIM sentence:  From late February , the UK Government position was that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm in accordance with the obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of UN inspectors to Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  By late August , the Government was troubled by intense speculation about whether a decision had already been taken to use military force

CLAIM sentence:  In Mr Blairs words, the US and UK had been outed as having taken a decision when no such decision had been taken

CLAIM sentence:  In his statement to Parliament on  September and in his answers to subsequent questions, Mr Blair presented Iraqs past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraqs weapons of mass destruction; and that, at some point in the future, that threat would become a reality

CLAIM sentence:  Rather than the debate being framed in terms of the answers needed to the outstanding questions identified by UNSCOM and the IAEA, including the material for which UNSCOM had been unable to account, the dossiers description of Iraqs capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK Government measured Iraqs future statements and actions and the success of weapons inspections

CLAIM sentence:  demonstrates, the judgements remained in place without challenge until the invasion of Iraq in March 

CLAIM sentence:  From October  onwards, the JIC focused on two main themes: compliance with the specific obligations imposed by resolution ; and Iraqs attitude to the return of the inspectors and, from  November, its Iraqs options, diplomatic and military, including the possible use of chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles against Coalition Forces or countries in the region in either preemptive attacks or in response to a military attack

CLAIM sentence:  As a result there was no formal reassessment of the JIC judgements, and the  September Assessment and the  September dossier provided part of the baseline for the UK Governments view of Iraqs capabilities and intentions on its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes

CLAIM sentence:  Given the weight which rested on the JICs judgements about Iraqs possession of WMD and its future intent for the decision in March that military action should, if necessary, be taken to disarm Iraq, a formal reassessment of the JICs judgements should have taken place

CLAIM sentence:  considers the impact of the failure to find stockpiles of WMD in Iraq in the months immediately after the invasion, and of the emerging conclusions of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), on: the Governments response to demands for an independent judgeled inquiry the Governments public presentation of the nature of the threat from Saddam into preconflict intelligence on Iraq; and Husseins regime and the decision to go to war

CLAIM sentence:  This was a major intelligence failure

CLAIM sentence:  Despite the failure to identify any evidence of WMD programmes during preconflict inspections, the UK Government remained confident that evidence would be found after the Iraqi regime had been removed

CLAIM sentence:  The Government maintained that position until January , backed by three votes in the House of Commons (on  June,  July and  October ) rejecting a succession of Opposition motions calling for an independent inquiry into the use of prewar intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  Planning for a postSaddam Hussein Iraq The failure to plan or prepare for known risks 

CLAIM sentence:  The information on Iraq available to the UK Government before the invasion provided a clear indication of the potential scale of the postconflict task

CLAIM sentence:  But when the invasion began, the UK Government was not in a position to conclude that satisfactory plans had been drawn up and preparations made to meet known postconflict challenges and risks in Iraq and to mitigate the risk of strategic failure

CLAIM sentence:  Throughout the planning process, the UK assumed that the US would be responsible for preparing the postconflict plan, that postconflict activity would be authorised by the UN Security Council, that agreement would be reached on a significant postconflict role for the UN and that international partners would step forward to share the postconflict burden

CLAIM sentence:  On that basis, the UK planned to reduce its military contribution in Iraq to medium scale within four months of the start of the invasion and expected not to have to make a substantial commitment to postconflict administration

CLAIM sentence:  By March , having failed to persuade the US of the advantages of a UNled interim administration, the UK had set the less ambitious goal of persuading the US to accept UN authorisation of a Coalitionled interim administration and an international presence that would include the UN

CLAIM sentence:  Discussions continued, but, as the invasion began: The UK had not secured US agreement to a Security Council resolution authorising postconflict administration and could not be sure when, or on what terms, agreement would be possible

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Annan emphasised to Ms Short the need for clarity on US thinking so that UN planning could proceed and told Sir Jeremy Greenstock that he would not wish to see any arrangement subjugating UN activity to Coalition activity

CLAIM sentence:  Despite being aware of the shortcomings of the US plan, strong US resistance to a leading role for the UN, indications that the UN did not want the administration of Iraq to become its responsibility and a warning about the tainted image of the UN in Iraq, at no stage did the UK Government formally consider other policy options, including the possibility of making participation in military action conditional on a satisfactory plan for the postconflict period, or how to mitigate the known risk that the UK could find itself drawn into a huge commitment of UK resources for which no contingency preparations had been made

CLAIM sentence:  Traditional in Iraq after conflict); the potential scale of the political, social, economic and security challenge (including from Sir Christopher Meyer (British Ambassador to the US) on  September : it will probably make pacifying Afghanistan look like childs play); the need for an analysis of whether the benefits of military action outweighed the risk of a protracted and costly nationbuilding exercise (including from Mr Straw on  July : the US must also understand that we are serious about our conditions for UK involvement); the absence of credible US plans for the immediate postconflict period and the subsequent reconstruction of Iraq (including from the British Embassy  Statement Blair,  January , page 

CLAIM sentence:  The UK was currently at risk of taking on a very substantial commitment that we will have great difficulty in sustaining beyond the immediate conclusion of conflict); and the importance (including in the UK overall plan for Phase IV, shown to Mr Blair on  March ) of: {{ UN authorisation for the military occupation of Iraq, without which there would be no legal cover for certain postconflict tasks; {{ a UN framework for the administration and reconstruction of Iraq during the transition to Iraqi selfgovernment

CLAIM sentence:  UK policy rested on the assumption that: in Iraq; the US would provide effective leadership of the immediate postconflict effort the conditions would soon be in place for UK military withdrawal; after a short period of USled, UNauthorised military occupation, the UN would administer and provide a framework for the reconstruction of postconflict Iraq; substantial international support would follow UN authorisation; and reconstruction and the political transition to Iraqi rule would proceed in a secure environment

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair did not: preparation; establish clear Ministerial oversight of postconflict strategy, planning and ensure that Ministers took the decisions needed to prepare a flexible, realistic and fully resourced plan integrating UK military and civilian contributions; seek adequate assurances that the UK was in a position to meet its likely insist that the UKs strategic objectives for Iraq were tested against obligations in Iraq; anything other than the best case: a wellplanned and executed USled and UNauthorised postconflict operation in a relatively benign security environment; press President Bush for definitive assurances about US postconflict plans or set out clearly to him the strategic risk in underestimating the postconflict challenge and failing adequately to prepare for the task; or consider, or seek advice on, whether the absence of a satisfactory plan was a sufficient threat to UK strategic objectives to require a reassessment of the terms of the UK engagement in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Despite concerns about the state of US planning, he did not make agreement on a satisfactory postconflict plan a condition of UK participation in military action

CLAIM sentence:  In the weeks immediately following the invasion, Mr Blairs omissions made it more difficult for the UK Government to take an informed decision on the establishment of the UKs postconflict Area of Responsibility (AOR) in southern Iraq (addressed in more detail in Section )

CLAIM sentence:  In the short to medium term, his omissions increased the risk that the UK would be unable to respond to the unexpected in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  However, the formal authorisation for action in Iraq issued by Adm Boyce on  March contained no instruction on how to establish a safe and secure environment if lawlessness broke out as anticipated

CLAIM sentence:  Faced with widespread looting after the invasion, and without instructions, UK commanders had to make their own judgements about what to do

CLAIM sentence:   Minute Reith to SECCOS,  April , Phase : Roulement/Recovery of UK Forces attaching Paper CJO,  April , Phase  Roulement/Recovery of UK Land Forces

CLAIM sentence:  Consequently, by the start of May there was a clearly articulated expectation of a rapid drawdown of UK forces by the autumn despite the identified risk that the consent of the local population was built on potentially vulnerable foundations, which could be undermined rapidly and with serious consequences

CLAIM sentence:  Reflecting in June , Mr David Richmond, the Prime Ministers Special Representative on Iraq from March to June , judged that the failure to crack down on looting in Baghdad in April  released a crime wave which the Coalition has never been able to bring fully under control

CLAIM sentence:  The low numbers were influenced in part by reasonable concerns about the personal legal liabilities of UK staff working initially in ORHA and then in the CPA, and what their deployment might imply about the UKs responsibility for decisions made by those organisations, in the absence of formal consultation or the right of veto

CLAIM sentence:  The preinvasion focus on a leading UN role in Iraq meant that little thought had been given to the status of UK personnel during an occupation which followed an invasion without Security Council authorisation

CLAIM sentence:  This created a risk described to the Inquiry by Sir Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser from  to , as the UK being held jointly responsible for acts or omissions of the CPA, without a right to consult and a right of joint decision

CLAIM sentence:  In the absence of formal arrangements, there was a clear risk that the UK would be inadequately involved in important decisions, and the UK struggled from the start to have a significant effect on the CPAs policies

CLAIM sentence: ), the announcement of which UK officials could not delay for long enough to enable the Attorney General to give his view on its legality under the terms of resolution 

CLAIM sentence:  No formal UK approval was sought for a document which was intended to provide strategic direction to the Coalitions nonmilitary effort in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  There had been a number of serious attacks on the Coalition in MND(SE), and Islamic extremists/terrorists were expected to remain a longterm threat in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry considers that a deterioration in security could and should have been identified by Lt Gen Reith by the end of August  and that the cumulative evidence of a deteriorating security situation should have led him to conclude that the underlying assumptions on which the UKs Iraq campaign was based was overoptimistic, and to instigate a review of the scale of the UKs military effort in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The failure to consider the option of reinforcement at this time was a serious omission and Lt Gen Reith and Gen Walker should have ensured that UK force levels in MND(SE) were formally reconsidered in autumn  or at the latest by the end of the year

CLAIM sentence:  Operation TELIC was the UK Main Effort, but deploying additional resources in a way that was compliant with the Defence Planning Assumptions would require the withdrawal of resources from other operations

CLAIM sentence:  Despite the failing security situation in MND(SE) in spring , Gen Walker was explicit that no additional troops were required for the tasks currently assigned to the UK

CLAIM sentence:  By midAugust, the level of attacks against coalition forces had matched the previous peak in April of the same year

CLAIM sentence:  It is possible that the UK may not have been able to make a real difference, when the key strategic change that might have affected the outcome was the deployment of a much larger force

CLAIM sentence:  In January , Lt Gen Fry produced a thoughtful and realistic assessment of the prospects for security in Iraq, observing that we are not on track to deliver the Steady State Criteria (SSC) before the UN mandate expires, or even shortly thereafter

CLAIM sentence:  Lt Gen Fry identified three possible courses of action for the UK: increasing the UK scale of effort, maintaining the status quo or, if it were judged that the campaign was irretrievable, accepting failure and seeking to mitigate UK liability

CLAIM sentence:  In , A New Chapter, an MOD review of the  Strategic Defence Review (SDR), had reaffirmed that the UKs Armed Forces would be unable to support two enduring medium scale military operations at the same time: Since the SDR we have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either a single major operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the Gulf War in ), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as in the mids in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial deployment 

CLAIM sentence:  Dr Reid, the Defence Secretary, announced that the UK was preparing for a deployment to southern Afghanistan which included a Provincial Reconstruction Team as part of a larger, more than ,strong British force providing the security framework

CLAIM sentence:  From July  onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were effectively made under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan

CLAIM sentence:  In one of his early acts as Defence Secretary, he announced the deployment of just over  additional personnel to enhance the UKs effort in training the ISF, which would enable them to take on ever greater responsibility for their own security and so pave the way for UK troops to withdraw

CLAIM sentence:  But despite concerns that had been expressed about the capacity of the ISF, Dr Reid recommended that a reduction in UK forces should take place in October or November 

CLAIM sentence:  Officials from the FCO, the MOD and DFID judged that the incident had highlighted the risks to achieving UK objectives in MND(SE), and that those risks had implications for military resources

CLAIM sentence:  They concluded that Ministers needed to be clear that the campaign could potentially be heading for strategic failure, with grave national and international consequences if the appropriate actions were not taken

CLAIM sentence:  In May , Mr Blair was told about rumblings from the US system about UK failure to grip the security situation in what they regard as a strategically vital part of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  By March , senior members of the UK military were considering the possibility of civil war in Iraq, prompted by rising levels of sectarian violence and concerns that the Iraqi Government was not 

CLAIM sentence:  Although there was general agreement that the situation in Iraq did not constitute civil war, the risk that one might develop was considered to be real

CLAIM sentence:  ACM Stirrup identified the risk that UK withdrawal from Basra would be seen as a strategic failure and suggested that astute conditioning of the UK public may be necessary to avoid that

CLAIM sentence:  ACM Stirrups acceptance that the law of diminishing returns was now firmly in play and that there was an increasing risk that UK forces would become part of the problem, rather than the solution had some validity: it was clear from accounts of the situation in Basra that UK forces were not preventing a steady decline in security

CLAIM sentence:  ACM Stirrup was also right to advise Dr Reid that the MNF in Iraq faced a multifaceted, sophisticated and dangerous enemy; that serious issues remained in Basra (militia activity, poor governance, insecurity); and that it was possible the UK would be accused of strategic failure

CLAIM sentence:  In August , ACM Stirrup was asked to give direction on both seeking US help for Op SALAMANCA and the possibility of deploying UK forces to support US operations outside MND(SE)

CLAIM sentence:  There was continuing resistance to any suggestion that UK forces should operate outside MND(SE) and there may have been concern that US participation in Op SALAMANCA would have led to an obligation on the UK to engage more outside MND(SE)

CLAIM sentence:  That may have been the right conclusion, but the effect was to deter consideration of a real problem and of ways in which military and civilian operations in MND(SE) could be better aligned

CLAIM sentence:  The balance of forces between Iraq and Afghanistan was reviewed by DOP in February  on the basis that the UK could only sustain the enduring operational deployment of eight battlegroups

CLAIM sentence:  ACM Stirrup advised that the UK should press ahead with drawdown from Iraq on the basis that there was little more the UK could achieve

CLAIM sentence:  As they reached the end of their respective tours of duty, both Major General Jonathan Shaw, General Officer Commanding MND(SE) from January to August , and Lieutenant General William Rollo, Senior British Military Representative Iraq from July  to March , identified the impact of limited resources on the UKs military effort and questioned the drive for continued drawdown in Iraq in order to prioritise resources for Helmand

CLAIM sentence:  From mid onwards, various senior individuals officials, military officers and Ministers began to consider whether the UK was heading towards strategic failure in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The term strategic failure was variously used to mean: the development of a widespread sectarian conflict or civil war in Iraq; victory for terrorist groups; collapse of the democratic process; failure to achieve the UKs objectives; failure to achieve a stable and secure environment in Basra; the collapse of the UK/Iraq relationship; the division of Iraq and the end of its existence as a nation state; damage to the UKs military and political reputation; and damage to the relationship between the US and UK

CLAIM sentence:  None of the contemporary accounts that the Inquiry has considered reached the conclusion that strategic failure was inevitable, although most recognised that without some form of corrective action it was a serious risk

CLAIM sentence:  No evidence had been identified that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, with which it might threaten its neighbours and the international community more widely

CLAIM sentence: : After the attacks on the US on /, Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand shoulder to shoulder with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  military action by the US, which he considered would undermine the success of the coalition which had been established for action against international terrorism

CLAIM sentence:  He recommended identifying an alternative policy which would command widespread international support

CLAIM sentence:  In December , Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq that would build over time, including if necessary taking military action without losing international support

CLAIM sentence:  He proposed that the UK and US should pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the return of weapons inspectors or face the consequences

CLAIM sentence:  invasion of Iraq was a profound change in UK thinking

CLAIM sentence: : By July , the UK Government had concluded that President Bush was impatient to move on Iraq and that the US might take military action in circumstances that would be difficult for the UK

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blairs Note, which had not been discussed or agreed with his colleagues, set the UK on a path leading to diplomatic activity in the UN and the possibility of participation in military action in a way that would make it very difficult for the UK subsequently to withdraw its support for the US

CLAIM sentence:  They proposed a strategy in which the first objective was to offer Iraq the opportunity and last chance to comply with its obligations to disarm

CLAIM sentence:  If Iraq did not take that opportunity and military action was required, the UK was seeking to establish conditions whereby such action would command multilateral support and be taken with the authority of the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November  the negotiation of resolution  

CLAIM sentence: : The declared objective of the US and UK was to obtain international support within the framework of the UN for a strategy of coercive diplomacy for the disarmament of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  That created deliberate ambiguities on a number of key issues including: the level of noncompliance with resolution  which would constitute a material breach; by whom that determination would be made; and whether there would be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use of force

CLAIM sentence: : Following the adoption of resolution , the UK was pursuing a strategy of coercive diplomacy to secure the disarmament of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  On  February, Mr Blair said that the UK would consider military action without a further resolution only if the inspectors reported that they could not do their job and a resolution was vetoed unreasonably

CLAIM sentence:  The UK would not take military action without a majority in the Security Council

CLAIM sentence:  The initial draft of a US, UK and Spanish resolution tabled on  February, which simply invited the Security Council to decide that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution , failed to attract support

CLAIM sentence:  A revised draft US, UK and Spanish resolution, tabled after the reports by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on  March and proposing a deadline of  March for Iraq to demonstrate full cooperation, also failed to attract support

CLAIM sentence:  Iraqs chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a threat to international peace and security in the Middle East, but overall, the threat from Iraq was viewed as less serious than that from other key countries of concern Iran, Libya and North Korea

CLAIM sentence: : The urgency and certainty with which the Government stated that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with fuelled the demand for publication of the dossier and led to Mr Blairs decision to publish it in September, separate from any decision on the way ahead

CLAIM sentence:  In his statement to Parliament on  September , Mr Blair presented Iraqs past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraqs weapons of mass destruction; and that at some point in the future that threat would become a reality

CLAIM sentence:  The dossiers description of Iraqs capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK Government measured Iraqs future statements and actions and the success of weapons inspections

CLAIM sentence: : The ingrained belief already described in this Section underpinned the UK Governments position that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with and it needed to disarm or be disarmed

CLAIM sentence:  There was no consideration of whether, faced with the prospect of a USled The JIC made the judgements in the UK Government September dossier part Iraqs statements that it had no weapons or programmes were dismissed as The extent to which the JICs judgements depended on inference and At no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might no longer have chemical, interpretation of Iraqs previous attitudes and behaviour was not recognised

CLAIM sentence: : The search for evidence of WMD in Iraq was started during the military campaign by Exploitation Task Force and was carried forward from June  by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG)

CLAIM sentence:  Faced with criticism of the preconflict intelligence and the absence of evidence of a current Iraqi WMD capability, Mr Blair sought to defend the decision to take military action by emphasising instead: {{ Saddam Husseins strategic intent; {{ the regimes breaches of Security Council resolutions; and {{ the positive impact of military action in Iraq on global counterproliferation efforts

CLAIM sentence:  The US wanted some UK capabilities (including Special Forces), to use UK bases, and the involvement of the UK military to avoid the perception of unilateral US military action

CLAIM sentence:  From late February , the UK judged that Saddam Husseins regime could In April , the MOD advised that, if the US mounted a major military only be removed by a USled invasion

CLAIM sentence:  Air and maritime forces were offered to the US for planning purposes The MOD advised in October that the UK was at risk of being excluded from in September

CLAIM sentence:  From August until December , other commitments meant that UK planning for Package  was based on providing a divisional headquarters and an armoured brigade for operations in northern Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  That was seen as the maximum practicable contribution the UK could generate within the predicted timescales for US action

CLAIM sentence:  That decision and its potential consequences were not formally considered In December , the deployment of  Commando Brigade was identified as a way for the UK to make a valuable contribution in the initial stages of a land campaign if transit through Turkey was refused

CLAIM sentence:  Following a visit to Turkey on  to  January , Mr Hoon concluded that there would be no agreement to the deployment of UK ground forces through Turkey

CLAIM sentence: : The decisions taken between midDecember  and midJanuary  to increase the combat force deployed to three brigades and bring forward the date on which UK forces might participate in combat operations compressed the timescales available for preparation

CLAIM sentence: : The decisions taken between midDecember  and midJanuary  to increase combat forces and bring forward the date on which UK forces might participate in combat operations compressed the timescales available for preparation

CLAIM sentence:  The achievements made in preparing the forces in the time available were very considerable, but the deployment of forces more quickly than anticipated in the Defence Planning Assumptions meant that there were some serious equipment shortfalls when conflict began

CLAIM sentence:  The information available to the Government before the invasion provided a clear indication of the potential scale of the postconflict task and the significant risks associated with the UKs proposed approach

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Blair, who recognised the significance of the postconflict phase, did not press President Bush for definite assurances about US plans, did not consider or seek advice on whether the absence of a satisfactory plan called for reassessment of the terms of the UKs engagement and did not make agreement on such a plan a condition of UK participation in military action

CLAIM sentence:  It took less than a month to achieve the departure of Saddam Hussein The decision to advance into Basra was made by military commanders The UK was unprepared for the media response to the initial difficulties

CLAIM sentence:  The UK acceded to the postinvasion US request that it assume leadership of a military Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompassing four provinces in southern Iraq, a position it then held for six years, without a formal Ministerial decision and without carrying out a robust analysis of the strategic implications for the UK or the militarys capacity to support the UKs potential obligations in the region

CLAIM sentence:  Forces reached the view that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that it would make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it might have greater effect

CLAIM sentence:  From July  onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were made under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan

CLAIM sentence:  The UK spent time and energy on rewriting strategies, which tended to describe UK forces withdrew from Iraq in  in circumstances which did not meet a desired end state without setting out how it would be reached

CLAIM sentence:  The UK failed to plan or prepare for the major reconstruction programme Reconstruction was the third pillar in a succession of UK strategies for Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The Governments decision to take part in military action against Iraq was not affected by consideration of the potential financial cost to the UK of the invasion or the postconflict period

CLAIM sentence:  Ministers were not provided with estimates of military conflict and postconflict costs, or with advice on their affordability, when decisions were taken on the scale of the UKs military contribution to a USled invasion of Iraq, and on the UKs role in the postconflict period

CLAIM sentence:  The issue of the potential pressure on Service Personnel was not a consideration in the decision

CLAIM sentence:  The following key findings are from Section : The Inquiry considers that a Government has a responsibility to make every reasonable effort to understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions on civilians

CLAIM sentence:  Unlike other instances in which military force has been used, the invasion was not prompted by the aggression of another country or an unfolding humanitarian disaster

CLAIM sentence:  When the potential for military action arises, the Government should not commit to a firm political objective before it is clear that it can be achieved

CLAIM sentence:  If a strategy of coercive diplomacy is being pursued, forces should be deployed in such a way that the threat of action can be increased or decreased according to the diplomatic situation and the policy can be sustained for as long as necessary

CLAIM sentence:  The widespread perception that the September  dossier overstated the firmness of the evidence about Iraqs capabilities and intentions in order to influence opinion and make the case for action to disarm Iraq has produced a damaging legacy, including undermining trust and confidence in Government statements, particularly those which rely on intelligence which cannot be independently verified

CLAIM sentence:  As a result, in situations where the policy response may involve military action and the evidence, at least in part, depends on inferential judgements drawn from necessarily incomplete intelligence, it may be more difficult to secure support for the Governments position and agreement to action

CLAIM sentence:  In addition, the Executive Summary gave prominence to the International Institute of Strategic Studies suggestion that Iraq would be able to assemble nuclear weapons within months if it could obtain fissile material, without reference to the material in the main text of the dossier which made clear that the UK took a very different view

CLAIM sentence:   Foreign Secretary, November , The Decision to go to War in Iraq Response of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, November , Cm, paragraph 

CLAIM sentence:  Although the UK expected to be involved in Iraq for a lengthy period after the conflict, the Government was unprepared for the role in which the UK found itself from April 

CLAIM sentence:  In relation to Iraq, the risks involved in the parallel deployment of two enduring medium scale operations were not examined with sufficient rigour and challenge

CLAIM sentence:  The management, in Whitehall, of a crossgovernment effort on the scale which was required in Iraq is a complex task

CLAIM sentence:  After the fall of a repressive regime, steps inevitably have to be taken to prevent those closely identified with that regime from continuing to hold positions of influence in public life

CLAIM sentence:  During the first four years of Op TELIC, there was no clear statement of policy setting out the acceptable level of risk to UK forces and who was responsible for managing that risk

CLAIM sentence:  In any future operation the level of force protection required to meet the assessed threat needs to be addressed explicitly

TOPIC 5 KEY WORDS: jic uk iraq assessment cabinet policy intelligence
Number of CLAIMS related to this TOPIC: 95

CLAIM sentence:  When UK policy towards Iraq was formally reviewed and agreed by the Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy (DOP) in May , the objectives towards Iraq were defined as: 

CLAIM sentence:  The US Presidential election in November  prompted a further UK review of the operation of the containment policy (see Section 

CLAIM sentence:   Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Secretary of State for Defence,  May , Iraq Future Strategy

CLAIM sentence:  The Key Judgements of a JIC Assessment in February  included: There was broad international consensus to maintain the arms embargo at least as long as Saddam remains in power

CLAIM sentence:  The UK should emphasise to the US that the preferred strategy was peaceful disarmament

CLAIM sentence:  He was focused on the need to establish evidence of an Iraqi breach, to persuade opinion of the case for action and to finalise the strategy with President Bush at the end of January

CLAIM sentence:  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities since the inspectors left in December  and the recently increased level of Iraqi cooperation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security Council with an assessment of Iraqs nuclear capabilities in the near future

CLAIM sentence:  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK on identifying tests but had reminded him that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence that Iraq possessed any WMD

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw suggested that the UK should adopt a strategy based on the argument that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution , and that the last three meetings of the Security Council met the requirement for Security Council consideration of reports of noncompliance

CLAIM sentence:  They included  key tasks identified by UNMOVIC where progress could have an impact on the Councils assessment of cooperation of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The UK assessment of Iraqs capabilities set out in Section  of the Report shows: The proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their delivery systems, particularly ballistic missiles, was regarded as a major threat

CLAIM sentence:  Practical cooperation between Iraq and Al Qaida was unlikely because There was no credible evidence of covert transfers of WMDrelated technology of mutual mistrust

CLAIM sentence:  On  January , the JIC assessed that, despite the presence of terrorists in Iraq with links to Al Qaida, there was no intelligence of current cooperation between Iraq and Al Qaida

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC Assessment of  January  sustained its earlier judgements on Iraqs ability and intent to conduct terrorist operations

CLAIM sentence:  While it was reasonable for the Government to be concerned about the fusion of proliferation and terrorism, there was no basis in the JIC Assessments to suggest that Iraq itself represented such a threat

CLAIM sentence:  In Section , the Inquiry has identified the importance of the ingrained belief of the Government and the intelligence community that Saddam Husseins regime retained chemical and biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was pursuing an active and successful policy of deception and concealment

CLAIM sentence:  At no stage was the proposition that Iraq might no longer have chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the policy community

CLAIM sentence:  Intelligence and assessments were used to prepare material to be used to support Government statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of the intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  Had the UK stood by its differing position on Iraq which was not an opposed position, but one in which the UK had identified conditions seen as vital by the UK Government the Inquiry does not consider that this would have led to a fundamental or lasting change in the UKs relationship with the US

CLAIM sentence:  The way in which the policy on Iraq was developed and decisions were taken and implemented within the UK Government has been at the heart of the Inquirys work and fundamental to its conclusions

CLAIM sentence:  Under UK constitutional conventions in which the Prime Minister leads the Government Cabinet is the main mechanism by which the most senior members of the Government take collective responsibility for its most important decisions

CLAIM sentence:  Cabinet is supported by a system of Ministerial Committees whose role is to identify, test and develop policy options; analyse and mitigate risks; and debate and hone policy proposals until they are endorsed across the Government

CLAIM sentence:  Discussions in Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee would have been supported by the relevant part of the Cabinet Secretariat, the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec)

CLAIM sentence:  where a small group is brought together to work on operational military planning and developing the diplomatic strategy, in future such a group will operate formally as an ad hoc Cabinet Committee

CLAIM sentence:   Cabinet Office, Review on Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction: Implementation of its Conclusions, March , Cm

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry considers that there should have been collective discussion by a Cabinet Committee or small group of Ministers on the basis of interdepartmental advice agreed at a senior level between officials at a number of decision points which had a major impact on the development of UK policy before the invasion of Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  There will, of course, be other policy issues which would benefit from the same approach

CLAIM sentence:  The right strategy was to engage closely with the Government of the United States in order to be in a position to shape policy and its presentation

CLAIM sentence:  Papers were submitted to the Cabinet Office, and in turn by the Cabinet Office to appropriate Cabinet Committees for decisions

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry also recognises that the nature of foreign policy, as the Report vividly demonstrates, requires the Prime Minister of the UK, the Foreign Secretary and their most senior officials to be involved in negotiating and agreeing policy on a daybyday, and sometimes hourbyhour basis

CLAIM sentence:  Cabinet Ministers need more information than will be available from the media, especially on sensitive issues of foreign and security policy

CLAIM sentence:  Lord Goldsmith wrote (paragraph ): A narrow textual reading of the resolution suggested no such assessment was needed because the Security Council had predetermined the issue

CLAIM sentence:  Senior Ministers should have considered the question posed in Mr Brummells letter of  March, either in the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee or a War Cabinet, on the basis of formal advice

CLAIM sentence:  Such a Committee should then have reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its members were asked to endorse the Governments policy

CLAIM sentence:  The majority of Cabinet members who gave evidence to the Inquiry took the position that the role of the Attorney General on  March was, simply, to tell Cabinet whether or not there was a legal basis for military action

CLAIM sentence:  While the detail of individual JIC Assessments on Iraq varied, this core construct remained in place

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC continued to judge that cooperation between Iraq and Al Qaida was unlikely, and that there was no credible evidence of Iraqi transfers of WMDrelated technology and expertise to terrorist groups

CLAIM sentence:  The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) was commissioned by No

CLAIM sentence:  The SIS report should have been shown to the relevant experts in the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) who could have advised their senior managers and the Assessments Staff

CLAIM sentence:  There is no evidence that other members of the JIC were aware at the time of the reservations recorded in the minute by Dr Brian Jones (the branch head of the nuclear, biological and chemical section in the Scientific and Technical Directorate of the Defence Intelligence Staff) of  September and that written by the chemical weapons expert in his team the following day

CLAIM sentence:  There is no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry is not questioning Mr Blairs belief, which he consistently reiterated in his evidence to the Inquiry, or his legitimate role in advocating Government policy

CLAIM sentence:  In its Assessment of  December, the JIC made the judgements in the UK Government September dossier part of the test for Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  The JIC Assessment of  October  stated that a good intelligence flow from inside Iraq, supporting tougher inspections, would be central to success

CLAIM sentence:  Iraqs statements that it had no weapons or programmes were dismissed as further evidence of a strategy of denial

CLAIM sentence:  At no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might not have chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the policy community

CLAIM sentence:  After its  September  Assessment, the JIC was not asked to review its judgements on Iraqs capabilities and programmes which underpinned UK thinking

CLAIM sentence:  Nor did the JIC itself suggest such a review

CLAIM sentence:  This might have been prompted by Dr Blixs report to the Security Council on  February , which demonstrated the developing divergence between the assessments presented by the US and UK

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry has not sought to comment in detail on the specific conclusions of the ISC, FAC, Hutton and Butler Reports, all of which were published before the withdrawal by SIS in September  of a significant proportion of the intelligence underpinning the JIC Assessments and September  dossier on which UK policy had rested

CLAIM sentence:  In addition to the conclusions of those reports, the Inquiry notes the forthright statement in March  of the US Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction

CLAIM sentence:  Reporting to President Bush, the Commission stated that the [US] Intelligence Community was dead wrong in almost all of its prewar judgments about Iraqs weapons of mass destruction

CLAIM sentence:  shows that, after the invasion, the UK Government, including the intelligence community, was reluctant to admit, and to recognise publicly, the mounting evidence that there had been failings in the UKs preconflict collection, validation, analysis and presentation of intelligence on Iraqs WMD

CLAIM sentence:  The lack of evidence to support preconflict claims about Iraqs WMD challenged the credibility of the Government and the intelligence community, and the legitimacy of the war

CLAIM sentence:  The Government and the intelligence community were both concerned about the consequences of the presentational aspects of their prewar assessments being discredited

CLAIM sentence:  By June, the Government had acknowledged the need for a review of the UKs preconflict intelligence on Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  After the publication of the ISG Interim Report, the Governments focus shifted from finding stockpiles of weapons to emphasising evidence of the Iraqi regimes strategic intent

CLAIM sentence:  The ISGs findings were significant, but did not support past statements by the UK and US Governments, which had focused on Iraqs current capabilities and an urgent and growing threat

CLAIM sentence:  In January , the UK sought to persuade the US of the benefits of UN leadership of Iraqs interim postconflict civil administration

CLAIM sentence:  At no stage did Ministers or senior officials commission the systematic evaluation of different options, incorporating detailed analysis of risk and UK capabilities, military and civilian, which should have been required before the UK committed to any course of action in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  It was the responsibility of officials to identify, analyse and advise on risk and Ministers responsibility to ensure that measures to mitigate identifiable risks, including a range of policy options, had been considered before significant decisions were taken on the direction of UK policy

CLAIM sentence:  The UK considered that an Interim Iraqi Administration should have real powers, and not be subordinate to the CPA

CLAIM sentence:  The text did not go so far as to require an interim administration to report formally to the CPA, as the US wished, but that was in effect how the relationship between the CPA and the Governing Council established by resolution  operated

CLAIM sentence:  UK involvement in CPA decisions about the scope and implementation of deBaathification policy is considered in Section 

CLAIM sentence:   Minute DCDS(C) to COSSEC,  December , Op TELIC Review of UK Military Strategy for Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  After force levels had been reviewed in January, the rationale for continued drawdown was based on adjusted criteria by which the success of Security Sector Reform would be judged, meaning that such reform would be implemented only to applicable standards for Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  For some time, there had been indications of tension between the US and UK regarding assessments of progress, and differing assumptions about whether plans were needed for longterm bases in Iraq

CLAIM sentence:  Gen Jackson felt compelled to report that: The perception, right or wrong, in some if not all US military circles is that the UK is motivated more by the shortterm political gain of early withdrawal than by the longterm importance of mission accomplishment; and that, as a result, MND(SE)s operational posture is too laissez faire and lacks initiative 

CLAIM sentence:  The adequacy of UK force levels in Iraq and the effectiveness of the UKs efforts in MND(SE) were explicitly questioned in Maj Gen Shirreffs end of tour report

CLAIM sentence:  The advice did identify US nervousness about the UK proposals

CLAIM sentence:  On  March, Dr ElBaradei reported that there was no indication that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities and that it should be able to provide the Security Council with an assessment of Iraqs activities in the near future

CLAIM sentence:  The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public from late  onwards conveyed more certainty than the JIC Assessments about Iraqs proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed

CLAIM sentence:  biological or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the policy community

CLAIM sentence:  A formal reassessment of the JICs judgements should have taken place after Dr Blixs report to the Security Council on  February  or, at the very latest, after his report of  March

CLAIM sentence:  Intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraqs capabilities and intent continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of the intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  an independent inquiry in favour of reviews initiated by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament

CLAIM sentence:  The ISGs principal findings that Iraqs WMD capability had mostly been destroyed in  but that it had been Saddam Husseins strategic intent to preserve the capability to reconstitute his WMD were significant, but did not support statements made by the UK and US Governments before the invasion, which had focused on Iraqs current capabilities and an urgent and growing threat

CLAIM sentence:  Such a Committee should then have reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its Members were asked to endorse the Governments policy

CLAIM sentence:  by a Cabinet Committee or reported to Cabinet

CLAIM sentence:  implementation of deBaathification policy to the Governing Council

CLAIM sentence: : In , the UK military was already operating at, and in some cases beyond, the limits of the guidelines agreed in the  Strategic Defence Review

CLAIM sentence:  A realistic assessment of the possibilities and limitations of armed force, and of the challenges of intervening in the affairs of other States, should help any future UK Government manage expectations, including its own

CLAIM sentence:  There will continue to be demands for factual evidence to explain the background to controversial policy decisions including, where appropriate, the explicit and public use of assessed intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  The Inquiry shares the Butler Reviews conclusions that it was a mistake not to see the risk of combining in the September dossier the JICs assessment of intelligence and other evidence with the interpretation and presentation of the evidence in order to make the case for policy action

CLAIM sentence:  But, from the evidence on the compilation of the September dossier, the lessons for any similar exercise in future would be: The need for clear separation of the responsibility for analysis and assessment of intelligence from the responsibility for making the argument for a policy

CLAIM sentence:  When assessed intelligence is explicitly and publicly used to support a policy decision, there would be benefit in subjecting that assessment and the underpinning intelligence to subsequent scrutiny, by a suitable, independent body, such as the Intelligence and Security Committee, with a view to identifying lessons for the future

CLAIM sentence:  the benefits of separating the responsibilities for assessment of intelligence from setting out the arguments in support of a policy

CLAIM sentence:  It shows that the intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraqs capabilities and intent continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of the intelligence

CLAIM sentence:  As the Foreign Affairs Committee report in July  pointed out, the late Sir Percy Cradock wrote in his history of the JIC that: Ideally, intelligence and policy should be close but distinct

CLAIM sentence:  Mr Straw told the FAC in : The reason why we have a Joint Intelligence Committee which is separate from the intelligence agencies is precisely so that those who are obtaining the intelligence are  Cradock, Sir Percy

CLAIM sentence:  That requires all government departments whose responsibilities will be engaged to have been formally involved in providing Ministers with coherent interdepartmental advice before decisions are taken; the proper function of the Cabinet Committee system

CLAIM sentence:  If future changes are to increase the effectiveness of UK operations, they must address the lessons for planning, preparation and implementation derived from the Iraq experience

CLAIM sentence:  Plans derived from that analysis should: incorporate a range of options appropriate to different contingencies; reflect a realistic assessment of UK (and partners) resources and capabilities; integrate civilian and military objectives and capabilities in support of a single be exposed to scrutiny and challenge at Ministerial, senior official and expert be reviewed regularly and, if the strategic context, risk profile or projected cost UK strategy; level; changes significantly, be revised

CLAIM sentence:  It is therefore critical for the SSR strategy to take full account of the history, culture and inherited practices of the country or region in question

CLAIM sentence:  Those responsible for making decisions on the investment in military capabilities should continually evaluate whether the balance between current operational requirements and longterm defence programmes is right, particularly to meet an evolving threat on current operations
