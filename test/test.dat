From mid‑2005 onwards various senior individuals  officials military officers and
Ministers  began to consider whether the UK was heading towards strategic failure
in Iraq
The term strategic failure was variously used to mean
the development of a widespread sectarian conflict or civil war in Iraq
victory for terrorist groups
collapse of the democratic process
failure to achieve the UK’s objectives
failure to achieve a stable and secure environment in Basra
the collapse of the UK Iraq relationship
the division of Iraq and the end of its existence as a nation state
damage to the UK’s military and political reputation and
damage to the relationship between the US and UK
None of the contemporary accounts that the Inquiry has considered reached the
conclusion that strategic failure was inevitable although most recognised that without
some form of corrective action it was a serious risk Although the UK revisited its Iraq strategy with considerable frequency no
substantial change in approach was ever implemented UK troop numbers continued
to reduce the size of the civilian deployment varied very little the Iraqiisation of security
and handover of responsibility to the Iraqi Government remained key objectivesThe Iraq of 2009 certainly did not meet the UK’s objectives as described in
January 2003 it fell far short of strategic success Although the borders of Iraq were the
same as they had been in 2003 deep sectarian divisions threatened both stability and
unity Those divisions were not created by the coalition but they were exacerbated by
its decisions on de‑Ba’athification and on demobilisation of the Iraqi Army and were not
addressed by an effective programme of reconciliation In January 2009 the JIC judged internal political failures that could lead to
renewed violence within and between Iraq’s Sunni Shia and Kurdish communities278
to be the greatest strategic threat to Iraq’s stability
The starting point for all discussions of reconstruction in circumstances
comparable to those in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 must be that this is an area where
progress will be extremely difficult

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

867 Better planning and preparation for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq would not
necessarily have prevented the events that unfolded in Iraq between 2003 and 2009
It would not have been possible for the UK to prepare for every eventuality Better
plans and preparation could have mitigated some of the risks to which the UK and Iraq
were exposed between 2003 and 2009 and increased the likelihood of achieving the
outcomes desired by the UK and the Iraqi people
868 From late 2003 successive reviews of the UK’s approach to post‑conflict
reconstruction later expanded to include the broader concept of stabilisation resulted
in a series of changes to the UK’s approach to post‑conflict operations Despite those
changes many of the shortcomings that characterised the UK Government’s approach to
pre‑conflict planning and preparation in 2002 and early 2003 persisted after the invasion
869 The UK Government’s new strategic framework for stabilisation the new
machinery for inter‑departmental co‑ordination and the enhanced resources now
available for stabilisation operations continue to evolve If future changes are to increase
the effectiveness of UK operations they must address the lessons for planning
preparation and implementation derived from the Iraq experience
870 The lessons identified by the Inquiry apply to both the planning and preparation
for post‑conflict operations of which reconstruction is a major but not the sole
component and to post‑conflict operations themselves
871 Analysis of the available material must draw on multiple perspectives reflect
dissenting views identify risk  including that associated with any gaps in knowledge 
and consider a range of options
872 Information must be shared as widely across departments as is necessary to
support that approach
873 Gathering information and analysis of the nature and scale of the potential task
should be systematic and as thorough as possible and should capture the views and
aspirations of local communities
874 Plans derived from that analysis should
incorporate a range of options appropriate to different contingencies
reflect a realistic assessment of UK and partners resources and capabilities
integrate civilian and military objectives and capabilities in support of a single
UK strategy
be exposed to scrutiny and challenge at Ministerial senior official and expert
level
be reviewed regularly and if the strategic context risk profile or projected cost
changes significantly be revised
Section 44 considers the impact of the failure to find stockpiles of WMD in Iraq
in the months immediately after the invasion and of the emerging conclusions of the
Iraq Survey Group ISG on
the Government’s response to demands for an independent judge‑led inquiry
into pre‑conflict intelligence on Iraq and
the Government’s public presentation of the nature of the threat from Saddam
Hussein’s regime and the decision to go to war
572 The Inquiry has not sought to comment in detail on the specific conclusions of the
ISC FAC Hutton and Butler Reports all of which were published before the withdrawal
by SIS in September 2004 of a significant proportion of the intelligence underpinning the
JIC Assessments and September 2002 dossier on which UK policy had rested
573 In addition to the conclusions of those reports the Inquiry notes the forthright
statement in March 2005 of the US Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the
United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction Reporting to President Bush
the Commission stated that the US Intelligence Community was dead wrong in almost
all of its pre‑war judgments about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction This was a major
intelligence failure
574 The evidence in Section 44 shows that after the invasion the UK Government
including the intelligence community was reluctant to admit and to recognise publicly
the mounting evidence that there had been failings in the UK’s pre‑conflict collection
validation analysis and presentation of intelligence on Iraq’s WMD
575 Despite the failure to identify any evidence of WMD programmes during pre‑conflict
inspections the UK Government remained confident that evidence would be found after
the Iraqi regime had been removed
576 Almost immediately after the start of the invasion UK Ministers and officials sought
to lower public expectations of immediate or significant finds of WMD in Iraq
577 The lack of evidence to support pre‑conflict claims about Iraq’s WMD challenged
the credibility of the Government and the intelligence community and the legitimacy
of the war
578 The Government and the intelligence community were both concerned about
the consequences of the presentational aspects of their pre‑war assessments
being discredited
579 By June the Government had acknowledged the need for a review of the UK’s
pre‑conflict intelligence on Iraq It responded to demands for an independent judge‑led
inquiry by expressing support for the reviews initiated by the ISC and the FAC

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry
78
580 The announcement of the Hutton Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the
death of Dr David Kelly on 18 July reinforced the Government’s position that additional
reviews were not needed
581 The Government maintained that position until January 2004 backed by three
votes in the House of Commons on 4 June 15 July and 22 October 2003 rejecting
a succession of Opposition motions calling for an independent inquiry into the use of
pre‑war intelligence
582 Mr Blair’s initial response to growing criticism of the failure to find WMD was
to counsel patience
583 After the publication of the ISG Interim Report the Government’s focus shifted
from finding stockpiles of weapons to emphasising evidence of the Iraqi regime’s
strategic intent
584 Once President Bush made clear his decision to set up an independent inquiry
Mr Blair’s resistance to a public inquiry became untenable
585 After the announcement of the Butler Review the UK Government’s focus shifted
to the content of the next ISG report the Status Report
586 The Government still concerned about the nature of the public debate on WMD
in the UK sought to ensure that the Status Report included existing ISG material
highlighting the strategic intentions of Saddam Hussein’s regime and breaches of
Security Council resolutions
